The system is macro-tidal with 8 m tides. The West Arm is the estuary of the Durack and Pentecost rivers, which are largely untouched by human activities. The East Arm is the estuary of the Ord River affected by land clearing which started 100 years ago, and by two river dams constructed 30 years ago. Prior to damming of the Ord River, the natural flow in all rivers was highly seasonal, characterized by small, at times negligible, flow during the dry season, which lasts eight months, and occasional river floods during the wet season, which lasts four months. The river flow has been regulated in the East Arm as a result of damming; this resulted in suppressing large river floods. The salinity intrusion length has decreased by about 50% in the East Arm following river damming. The East Arm has silted measurably over the last 30 years, with the stream cross-sectional area decreasing by about 50%. Field and numerical studies suggest that this is due to the dam-induced suppression of large river floods, which has in turn allowed a greater amount of tidal pumping of sediment into the East Arm from Cambridge Gulf. Since tidal pumping is increasing as the system is silting, the East Arm appears to now be geomorphologically unstable as a result of human activities. Numerical studies suggest it may take as little as 100 years for the Ord River to reach a new equilibrium. Modelling suggests that this equilibrium may be characterized by a salinity intrusion length half that before damming, a channel width and depth reduced by 70%, and a much stronger tidal asymmetry characterized by an increasing size of the tidal bore. The West Arm appears to be at equilibrium since there has been no net loss or gain of sediment for the last 111 years. Tidal dynamics and river floods appear responsible for self-scouring this channel.

Environmental water provisions are under consideration for the Ord River in far northern Western Australia. This river has been regulated for irrigation and there are plans for substantial expansion. Like other semi-arid and tropical rivers, however, the hydrology of the Ord River is highly variable and unpredictable, and therefore, proportionate water release strategies for the environment that are based on average monthly flows are unsuitable. Regulation continues to produce pronounced ecological changes throughout the river system as the impacts of flow regime are negated. There is a dichotomy in optimal flow regimes for the contrasting management aspirations of ecological restoration based on low seasonal flows, and the dilution flows required for the drainage of agricultural effluent. Whilst current agricultural land and water management practices continue, the two cannot coincide, and consequently, a decision should be made regarding which environmental water allocation holds the primary value.

The tidal prism substantially exceeds river discharge throughout the lower 65 km of the channel, and most of the sediments contributed to the system by the river are transported and deposited by tidal currents. The tide wave is symmetrical at the mouth but becomes deformed upstream owing to a high amplitude\/depth ratio. Accordingly, the velocity of flood currents increasingly exceeds ebb velocities upstream, whereas ebb flow increases in duration. In and seaward of the mouth, bed-load transports by flood- and ebb tide currents are approximately equal. Linear subaqueous sand ridges parallel to tidal currents separate mutually evasive zones of flood- and ebb-dominated sediment transport and appear to be related to convergence of flood- and ebb-oriented bedforms. In response to the upstream increase in tide-wave asymmetry, the largest bedforms within the channel migrate upstream under the influence of flood currents. The upstream increase in asymmetry of the channel cross section and in channel sinuosity. This results in concentrating ebb flows in the decreased cross section of channels, where bed-load transport is ebb-dominated, thereby balancing the sediment budget.","JournalOrPublisher":"Elsevier Science & Technology","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"DOI:10.1016\/B978-0-12-197502-9.50024-1","URL":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/B9780121975029500241","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0007Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Estuarine"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Sediments","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Volkman, J.

Two field trips were undertaken to obtain samples from both the dry (September, 2002) and wet (February, 2003) seasons. Both biomarker and stable isotope data indicate predominant contributions of organic material from the surrounding vegetation. However, the character of the terrestrial organic matter changes from the freshwater to the marine sections of the river. The sterol profiles in the freshwater sediments are relatively simple and dominated by the C29 sterols 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3\u03b2-ol (sitosterol) and 24-ethylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol (stigmasterol) with small quantities of 24-methylcholest-5-en-3\u03b2-ol (campesterol), all of which are common sterols in higher plants. In the dry season survey, triterpenoid alcohols were generally absent from the freshwater sediments, but in the wet season there was a small contribution from compounds such as \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin and lupeol, indicating additional higher plant input, possibly from further inland in the catchment. Within Cambridge Gulf and the Ord estuary, the waterways are fringed with mangroves which contribute substantial quantities of organic matter as shown by distinctive distributions of triterpenoid alcohols dominated by taraxerol. However, this is not the major triterpenoid in the mangrove trees studied, but seems to be considerably more stable to biodegradation and so dominates the triterpenoids found. Isotope, biomarker (fatty acids, phytol and sterols) and pigment data suggest that only a small part of the sedimentary organic matter is derived from microalgae. Contributions from diatoms (24-methylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol; fucoxanthin), green algae (\u03947-sterols), cyanobacteria (C32 hopanol; zeaxanthin) and dinoflagellates (dinosterol; peridinin) could be recognized. In this environment the high turbidity of the water column severely limits phytoplankton production, although productivity of microphytobenthos on the banks of the river can potentially be high.","JournalOrPublisher":"Organic Geochemistry","Volume":"38","Issue":"7","DOI":"DOI:10.1016\/j.orggeochem.2007.02.017","URL":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0146638007000678","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0008Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Riparian","Terrestrial"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Catchment management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"17\/2004","Authors":"Payne, A.L., I.W.

This study examined changes to riparian vegetation caused by the construction of two dams. The study has important implications for development of water allocation plans. In the post-dam era, relative hydrological stability brought about by curtailment of large floods and provision of perpetual flow in a once-seasonal river has allowed extensive development of emergent aquatic and fringing woodland communities throughout the study reach. The emergent aquatic communities and most of their component species were previously absent but the tree component of fringing woodland communities comprises species that were present before the dams were constructed, albeit in isolated, sheltered pockets. Limitations to the use of photographs included absence of any images through the first 50 years of pastoral use of the area, limited number of sites that attracted photographers and limits to the discernible detail (e.g. identity of species, even most trees, in landscape images).","JournalOrPublisher":"Australian Journal of Botany","Volume":"50","Issue":"4","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/BT01060\n","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/bt\/BT01060","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0010Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Estuarine"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Thom, B.

Studies in the deltaic coastal plain of Tabasco, Mexico, determined that patterns of mangrove develop- ment, including species distribution, physiognomy and community structure, evolve over time as a result of geomorphic processes which produce, modify and finally remove plant habitats (Thom 1967). In that area the nature of geomorphic change is such that the plants themselves play minimum roles in the modification of habitat conditions. In this paper the degree of control of mangrove ecology by geomorphic processes, which was so evident in the micro-tidal, humid Tabasco, has been further examined in the Cambridge Gulf-Ord River region of Western Australia, a region where the tidal and climatic characteristics are markedly different from those of Tabasco. No systematic ecology has been undertaken on the coastal flora of northern Western Australia, although brief reports on plant distribution have been given by Ostenfeld (1918), Gardner (1923), Sauer (1965), Beard (1967) and Perry (1970). Mangroves of this region are described as 'depauperate outliers of the complex Indo-Malayan forests' (Sauer 1965, p. 51). The Cambridge Gulf-Ord River section of this coast is a deltaic region subject to high tidal range (8 m), a semi-arid climate with summer rainfall, and high rates of sediment discharge particularly in the summer months. These three factors are largely responsible for the nature of the geomorphic change which occurs within the delta. Mangroves are distributed throughout the area in a variety of habitats. It is the pur- pose of this paper (i) to examine the distribution of these habitats, and the mangrove species and growth forms which occur within them, in relation to their geomorphology, and (ii) to discuss the inferred pattern of vegetation change. Vegetational dynamics are viewed from the perspective of a geomorphologist interested in present-day changes in landforms as well as in the geological development of deltaic and tidal-flat deposits associ- ated with sea level movements of the last 10 000 years.

Near the coast, prograding shorelines are characterized by extensive mangrove successional sequences and scattered thin beach-ridge deposits. In the interfluve regions and farther inland along the coast, tidal-plain sedimentation has given rise to extensive flats that are bare of vegetation at approximately the high spring tide level. Evaporites, algal-layered silts and clays, and massive sandy deposits form the bulk of these tidal-flat sediments. Sinuous tidal channels, displaying low width\/depth ratios and characterized by a progressive tide wave, are found throughout the coastal tidal-flat region. These channels migrate laterally, leaving preserved channel sand bodies isolated in tidal deposits. In the funnel-shaped channel of the Ord River, the major river in the region receiving freshwater runoff, the tide wave is symmetrical at the mouth but becomes deformed upstream owing to a high amplitude\/depth ratio; thus the velocity of flood currents increasingly exceeds ebb velocities upstream and ebb flow increases in duration. In the upper portions of the tide-dominated river channel, the largest bedforms within the channel migrate upstream under the influence of dominant flood currents, choking the channel with sand deposits. Extensive channel migration and meandering are characteristic of this region of the channel. In addition, extensive overbank crevassing occurs, a process that forms the bulk of the fluvial deposition. In the lower Ord River, linear, elongate tidal ridges within and seaward of the channel form the major sand deposits of the delta. These environments and their distribution and geometrical relationships characterize arid, high-tidal-dominated river systems.","JournalOrPublisher":"The Journal of Geology","Volume":"86","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1086\/649728","URL":"https:\/\/www.journals.uchicago.edu\/doi\/epdf\/10.1086\/649728","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0013Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater","Riparian"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Social, cultural and economic values","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Barber, K., H.

The three sampling sites were the irrigation area, downstream of the irrigation area, and well upstream of the irrigation area; the last site serving as the control. DDT and toxaphene were applied in large and known quantities to cotton grown in the Ord Irrigation Area from 1964 to 1974. Thus the residues in the crocodile tissues are representative of the situation almost thirty years after the use of DDT and toxaphene ceased in the area. Very high concentrations of p,p\u2032-DDE and toxaphene were found in the lipid-rich tissues that were examined. Livers and body fat from estuarine crocodiles Crocodylus porosus from the downstream site were also analysed. As p,p\u2032-DDE and toxaphene are both known to be disruptive of endocrine systems, a range of blood parameters, including estradiol and testesterone concentrations, were also measured for all the animals studied. The ovaries and testes of the freshwater crocodiles were also examined histologically. There were no obvious effects on blood chemistry or gonad histology of the large burden of pesticides and their metabolites carried by exposed animals, although the limited number of samples and the variability of the breeding state of the animals examined may have masked possible effects. The isolation of the area, the accurately known applications of DDT and toxaphene, and the simplicity of the drainage system make the lower Ord River a unique natural laboratory for studying the long term breakdown and effects of pesticides applied in a tropical environment.","JournalOrPublisher":"Journal of Environmental Monitoring","Volume":"8","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"DOI:10.1039\/B518059G","URL":"\/documents\/0014Or-Yoshikane-2006-Journal_Article.pdf","File_name":"0014Or-Yoshikane-2006-Journal_Article.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0015Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Disease ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Liehne, P.

This study investigated intraspecific trait variation across three contrasting aquatic flow habitat types (intermittent creek, billabong and river) in a common mouth-brooding freshwater fish in northern Australia, the mouth almighty Glossamia aprion. Samples of G. aprion were collected at various sites, within the Daly River catchment. It was predicted that a number of morphological and reproductive traits would vary among individuals across the contrasting habitats. Five out of the nine morphological and reproductive traits studied significantly varied across flow habitat types. Significant intraspecific variation in functional traits related to foraging and reproduction, such as relative eye size, eye vertical position and relative maxillary length in males suggest that the inherent characteristics of each flow habitat type could be exerting selective pressure on the morphology of G. aprion. Interestingly, traits related to swimming performance (body lateral shape) and manoeuvrability (pectoral fin ventral position) differed between flow habitat types but showed inconsistent responses to predictions. Whilst this study was temporally and spatially limited, it highlights that intraspecific variability in morphological traits can occur among flow habitat types over relatively small spatial scales. \u00a9 2018 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles","JournalOrPublisher":"Journal of Fish Biology","Volume":"93","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1111\/jfb.13821","URL":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378112797001588","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0017Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Land management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Adams, V.M.; Pressey R.L.","Year":"2014","Title":"Uncertainties around the implementation of a clearing-control policy in a unique catchment in northern Australia: Exploring equity issues and balancing competing objectives","Abstract_Description":"Land use change is the most significant driver linked to global species extinctions. In Northern Australia, the landscape is still relatively intact with very low levels of clearing. However, a re-energized political discourse around creating a northern food bowl means that currently intact ecosystems in northern Australia could be under imminent threat from increased land clearing and water extraction. These impacts are likely to be concentrated in a few regions with suitable soils and water supplies. The Daly River Catchment in the Northern Territory is an important catchment for both conservation and development. Land use in the Daly catchment has been subject to clearing guidelines that are largely untested in terms of their eventual implications for the spatial configuration of conservation and development. Given the guidelines are not legislated they might also be removed or revised by subsequent Territory Governments, including the recently-elected one. We examine the uncertainties around the spatial implications of full implementation of the Daly clearing guidelines and their potential effects on equity of opportunity across land tenures and land uses. We also examine how removal of the guidelines could affect conservation in the catchment. We conclude that the guidelines are important in supporting development in the catchment while still achieving conservation goals, and we recommend ways of implementing the guidelines to make best use of available land resources for intensified production. \u00a9 2014 Adams, Pressey.","JournalOrPublisher":"PLoS ONE","Volume":"9","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1371\/journal.pone.0096479","URL":"\/documents\/0017Da-Adams-2014-Journal_Article.pdf","File_name":"0017Da-Adams-2014-Journal_Article.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0018Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Conservation management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Adams, V.M.; Pressey R.L.; \u00c1lvarez-Romero J.G.","Year":"2016","Title":"Using optimal land-use scenarios to assess trade-offs between conservation, development, and social values","Abstract_Description":"Development of land resources can contribute to increased economic productivity but can also negatively affect the extent and condition of native vegetation, jeopardize the persistence of native species, reduce water quality, and Erode ecosystem services. Spatial planning must therefore balance outcomes for conservation, development, and social goals. One approach to evaluating these trade-offs is scenario planning. In this paper we demonstrate methods for incorporating stakeholder preferences into scenario planning through both defining scenario objectives and evaluating the scenarios that emerge. In this way, we aim to develop spatial plans capable of informing actual land-use decisions. We used a novel approach to scenario planning that couples optimal land-use design and social evaluation of environmental outcomes. Four land-use scenarios combined differences in total clearing levels (10% and 20%) in our study region, the Daly Catchment Australia, with the presence or absence of spatial precincts to concentrate irrigated agriculture. We used the systematic conservation planning tool Marxan with Zones to optimally plan for multiple landuses that met objectives for both conservation and development. We assessed the performance of the scenarios in terms of the number of objectives met and the degree to which existing land-use policies were compromised (e.g., whether clearing limits in existing guidelines were exceeded or not). We also assessed the land-use scenarios using expected stakeholder satisfaction with changes in the catchment to explore how the scenarios performed against social preferences. There were a small fraction of conservation objectives with high conservation targets (100%) that could not be met due to current land uses; all other conservation and development objectives were met in all scenarios. Most scenarios adhered to the existing clearing guidelines with only marginal exceedances of limits, indicating that the scenario objectives were compatible with existing policy. We found that two key stakeholder groups, agricultural and Indigenous residents, had divergent satisfaction levels with the amount of clearing and agricultural development. Based on the range of benefits and potential adverse impacts of each scenario, we suggest that the 10% clearing scenarios are most aligned with stakeholder preferences and best balance preferences across stakeholder groups. Our approach to scenario planning is applicable generally to exploring the potential conflicts between goals for conservation and development. Our case study is particularly relevant to current discussion about increased agricultural and pastoral development in northern Australia. Copyright: \u00a9 2016 Adams et al.

We estimate the potential costs of a stewardship program in the Daly River catchment, Northern Territory, which would underwrite the cost difference between routine land management and the additional requirements of conservation management on grazing properties. Based on survey responses from landholders, we first assess the current costs of land management in the catchment and use regression to identify key drivers of spatial variation in both routine land management costs and conservation-oriented management costs. We define conservation-oriented management costs as the costs required to meet objectives for both routine property management and conservation. We then estimate the additional costs of conservation management over and above routine land management at an average of $1.99. per ha. We conclude that, if the most cost-effective properties are targeted, an annual budget of $1 million would support stewardship agreements covering 90% of the catchment's area.

Planning for multiple land uses requires navigating trade-offs between social, economic, and environmental outcomes arising from different possible futures. To explore these trade-offs, we use the Daly River catchment, in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory, as a case study. The catchment contains areas of priority for both conservation and development. In response to the challenge of navigating the required trade-offs, the Daly River Management Advisory Committee (DRMAC) initiated a land-use plan for the region. Both development and conservation of natural resources in the catchment will affect human well-being and the long-term provisioning of ecosystem services in diverse ways. To understand some of these impacts, an innovative engagement process was designed to elicit the relative importance of key factors to residents\u2019 well-being. The process identified 19 well-being factors grouped into four domains: biodiversity, socio-cultural, recreational, and commercial. Overall, the highest-ranked well-being factors were in the social-cultural and biodiversity domains while commercial values were ranked the least important. Respondents reported low satisfaction with commercial factors as well, noting concerns over environmental impacts from existing developments and sustainability of future developments. We identified differences in the reported importance values for several types of stakeholders, most notably between indigenous respondents and those employed in the agricultural sectors. Indigenous respondents placed greater importance on biodiversity and socio-cultural factors. Agricultural respondents placed greater importance on commercial factors. The outcomes of our engagement were integrated into DRMAC\u2019s process of objective-setting to ensure that objectives for each domain were included in land-use planning. Our results can also anticipate potential conflicts between different stakeholders and changes in well-being associated with different land uses. We describe how our findings will inform the next stages of stakeholder engagement and comment on the utility of such an approach for integrating well-being into objective setting for land-use and scenario planning. \u00a9 2014 by the author(s).

However most studies have been focused on small-scale bore processes. The present paper describes the first quantitative study, at the estuary scale, of the conditions for tidal bore formation in convergent alluvial estuaries. When freshwater discharge and large-scale spatial variations of the estuary water depth can be neglected, tide propagation in such estuaries is controlled by three main dimensionless parameters: the nonlinearity parameter epsilon(0), the convergence ratio delta(0) and the friction parameter phi(0). In this paper we explore this dimensionless parameter space, in terms of tidal bore occurrence, from a database of 21 estuaries (8 tidal-bore estuaries and 13 non tidal-bore estuaries). The field data point out that tidal bores occur for convergence ratios close to the critical convergence delta(c). A new proposed definition of the friction parameter highlights a clear separation on the parameter plane (phi(0),epsilon(0)) between tidal-bore estuaries and non tidal-bore estuaries. More specifically, we have established that tidal bores occur in convergent estuaries when the nonlinearity parameter is greater than a critical value, epsilon(c), which is an increasing function of the friction parameter phi(0). This result has been confirmed by numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Saint Venant equations. The real-estuary observations and the numerical simulations also show that, contrary to what is generally assumed, tide amplification is not a necessary condition for tidal bore formation. The effect of freshwater discharge on tidal bore occurrence has been analyzed from the database acquired during three long-term campaigns carried out on the Gironde\/Garonne estuary. We have shown that in the upper estuary the tidal bore intensity is mainly governed by the local dimensionless tide amplitude epsilon. The bore intensity is an increasing function of epsilon and this relationship does not depend on freshwater discharge. However, freshwater discharge damps the tidal wave during its propagation and thus reduces epsilon and consequently limits the tidal bore development in the estuary. To take into account this process in the tidal-bore scaling analysis, it is necessary to introduce a fourth external parameter, the dimensionless river discharge 2(0). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This has been achieved through longitudinal surveys of gaseous tracers, but their effectiveness can be limited by rapid equilibration between the stream and the atmosphere. Here we develop the use of carbon-14 in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in a stream as a tracer of groundwater discharge. A controlled equilibration experiment was conducted, during which groundwater with an initial 14C activity of 5.5pMC was allowed to equilibrate with the atmosphere over 72days. The effective transfer velocity for 14C was measured as 0.013md-1. The method was then tested at an artificial groundwater discharge location, where the effective transfer velocity was measured as 0.025md-1. In these simple systems, the ratio of the effective 14C transfer velocity to the CO2 gas transfer velocity is a function of pH, and proportional to the fraction of DIC present as CO2. The method was then applied along a reach of the Daly River, Australia, where groundwater discharge is known to occur. A decrease of 7pMC was observed across the major spring discharge zone, with subsequent equilibration with the atmosphere occurring over at least tens of kilometres. This allowed for the effective transfer velocity to be estimated at between 0.09 and 0.15md-1, and for the 14C activity of groundwater discharge to be estimated at between 60 and 66pMC. The equilibration of 14C in stream DIC is in the order of 10 times slower than for gas tracers, which may allow for the detection of smaller groundwater discharge fluxes than is possible with gas tracers. If the total groundwater discharge flux is known, measurements of 14C in stream DIC can also be used to infer the 14C activity of discharging groundwater. This method may be a useful alternative to direct groundwater sampling, particularly in remote basins with few groundwater wells. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.","JournalOrPublisher":"Journal Of Hydrology","Volume":"519","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"DOI:10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2014.06.056","URL":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0022169414005162","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0026Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Biodiversity","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Braby M.F.; Williams M.R.; Coppen R.A.M.; Williams A.A.E.; Franklin D.C.","Year":"2020","Title":"Patterns of species richness and endemism of butterflies and day-flying moths in the monsoon tropics of northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"Patterns of species richness and endemism were analyzed for 154 resident\/breeding diurnal Lepidoptera in 153 grid cells (100 km \u00d7 100 km) based on a recently published set of spatial distribution maps (range-map and atlas data) in the western and central Australian Monsoon Tropics biome of northern Australia (~1.2 million km2).

Here we use Cs-137 concentrations to determine the erosion processes supplying sediment to two major northern Australian Rivers; the Daly River (Northern Territory), and the Mitchell River (Queensland). We also present data from five sediment samples collected from a 100 km reach of the Cloncurry River, a major tributary of the Flinders River (Queensland). Concentrations of Cs-137 in the surface soil and subsurface (channel banks and gully) samples were used to derive 'best fit' probability density functions describing their distributions. These modelled distributions are then used to estimate the relative contribution of these two components to the river sediments. Our results are consistent with channel and gully erosion being the dominant source of sediment, with more than 90% of sediment transported along the main stem of these rivers originating from subsoil. We summarize the findings of similar studies on tropical Australian rivers and conclude that the primary source of sediment delivered to these systems is gully and channel bank erosion. Previously, as a result of catchment scale modelling, sheet-wash and rill erosion was considered to be the major sediment source in these rivers. Identifying the relative importance of sediment sources, as shown in this paper, will provide valuable information for land management planning in the region. This study also reinforces the importance of testing model predictions before they are used to target investment in remedial action. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

IV* Analysis of climatic risk","Abstract_Description":"The establishment of a pulp and paper industry based on kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) in semi-arid northern Australia requires clear demonstration of the long-term production potential of kenaf in this region. Owing to the high rainfall variability both within and among seasons, it would be difficult to assess the potential of a new dryland industry from traditional experimentation. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to assess the climatic risks to dryland kenaf production in the Northern Territory (NT) using the kenaf simulation model NTKENAF, which has been developed and validated for this climatic zone. The kenaf model was run, using long-term historical weather data, to determine optimal sowing strategies and expected yields at four representative sites in the NT. In the NT, a codict existed between sowing early, with resulting long duration and high yield potential, but high probability of plant mortality, and sowing later, with more reliable plant population, but shorter duration and lower yields. A general recommendation over all sites was for a sowing window extending from the start of November to mid-December each year; lower yields were simulated for earlier sowing dates due to problems with crop establishment, and for later sowing dates due to crop growth extending past the end of the wet season in most years. However, in circumstances of high rainfall prior to November, there was a yield advantage at several sites from sowing early. Over the 100 years of climatic data for Katherine (14\u00b0 28\u2018S.) and sowing when 30 mm rainfall occurred in a 5-day period after 1 November, simulated stem yields for kenaf ranged from 800 to 17200 kg ha-1, with a mean stem yield of 8673 kg ha-1 and coefficient of variation of 42%. At the higher rainfall site of Douglas Daly (13\u00b0 48\u2018S.), over 21 seasons and using the same sowing criterion, stem yields ranged from 4490 to 19 200 kg ha-1, with a mean stem yield of 12 509 kg ha-1 and coefficient of variation of 27%. Simulated stem yields were higher at the wettest site of Adelaide River (13\u00b0 06\u2018S.) and lowest at the driest site of Larrimah (15\u00b0 36\u2018S.). In the planning of a potential kenaf industry in the northern Australia, this research study has provided the essential information of yield probability distributions for kenaf crops grown at selected sites in the NT. \u00a9 1993 CSIRO.

However, a spatial conservation prioritization framework that integrates these key aspects, and can be generalized, is still missing. Moreover, assessing the robustness of prioritization frameworks to uncertainty in species responses to management is critical to avoid misallocation of limited resources. Yet, the impact of information uncertainty on prioritization of management effort remains unknown. We present an approach for prioritizing alternative levels of conservation management effort to multiple actions, based on the ecological responses of species to management. We estimated species responses through a structured email-based expert elicitation process, where we also captured the uncertainty in individual experts' assessments. We identified priority locations and associated level of management of effort of four actions to abate threats to freshwater-dependent fauna, using a northern Australia case study, and quantified sensitivity of the proposed solution to uncertainty in the answers of each individual expert. Achievement of conservation targets for freshwater-dependent fauna in the Daly River catchment would require 9.4\u00a0million AU$ per year, for a total of approximately 189 million AU$ investment over 20\u00a0years. We suggest that this could be best achieved through a mix of aerial shooting of buffalos and pigs, riparian fencing and chemical spraying of weeds, applied at varying levels of management effort in key areas of the catchment. Uncertainty in experts' estimation of species responses to threats causes 60% of the species to achieve 80% of their conservation targets, which was consistent across target levels. Synthesis and applications. Our prioritization approach facilitates the planning of conservation management at fine spatial scales and is applicable to terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms. Plan implementation may require policy instruments ranging from landowner stewardship agreements, market-based mechanisms and low-intensity land use management schemes, to regulation of commercial activities within portions of marine protected areas. However, assessing plan sensitivity to uncertainty in species response to management and finding ways of dealing with it in the prioritization rather than ignoring it, as often done, remains vital for effective achievement of conservation objectives. \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

Currently, the Daly River is unregulated, with only a small volume of water extracted annually for agriculture. However, there is considerable pressure for further agricultural development in the catchment, particularly with demand for extra water extraction during the dry season (May-November). The abundances of two fish species-barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and sooty grunter (Hephaestus fuliginosus)-were chosen as the ecological endpoints for the models, which linked dry season flows to key aspects of the biology of each species. Where available, data were used to define flow-fish habitat relationships, but most of the relationships were defined by expert opinion because of a lack of quantified ecological knowledge. Recent field data on fish abundances were used to validate the models and gave prediction errors of 20-30%. The barramundi model indicated that the adult sub-population was key to overall fish abundance, with this sub-population particularly impacted by the timing of abstraction (early vs. late dry season). The sooty grunter model indicated that the juvenile sub-population dominated the overall abundance and that this was primarily due to the amount of hydraulically suitable riffle habitat. If current extraction entitlements were fully utilized, the models showed there would be significant impacts on the populations of these two fish species, with the probability of unacceptable abundances increasing to 43% from 25% for sooty grunter and from 36% for barramundi under natural conditions. \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","JournalOrPublisher":"River Research And Applications","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"3","DOI":"DOI:10.1002\/rra.1456","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/rra.1456","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0033Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Estuarine"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Coastal hydraulics","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Chanson H.","Year":"2011","Title":"Undular tidal bores: Effect of channel constriction and bridge piers","Abstract_Description":"A tidal bore may occur in a macro-tidal estuary when the tidal range exceeds 4.5-6 m and the estuary bathymetry amplifies the tidal wave. Its upstream propagation induces a strong mixing of the estuarine waters. The propagation of undular tidal bores was investigated herein to study the effect of bridge piers on the bore propagation and characteristics. Both the tidal bore profile and the turbulence generated by the bore were recorded. The free-surface undulation profiles exhibited a quasi-periodic shape, and the potential energy of the undulations represented up to 30% of the potential energy of the tidal bore. The presence of the channel constriction had a major impact on the free-surface properties. The undular tidal bore lost nearly one third of its potential energy per surface area as it propagated through the channel constriction. The detailed instantaneous velocity measurements showed a marked effect of the tidal bore passage suggesting the upstream advection of energetic events and vorticity \"clouds\" behind the bore front in both channel configurations: prismatic and with constriction. The turbulence patches were linked to some secondary motions and the proposed mechanisms were consistent with some field observations in the Daly River tidal bore. The findings emphasise the strong mixing induced by the tidal bore processes, and the impact of bridge structures on the phenomenon. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","JournalOrPublisher":"Environmental Fluid Mechanics","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"4","DOI":"DOI:10.1007\/s10652-010-9189-5","URL":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10652-010-9189-5","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0034Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Estuarine"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Sediments","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Chappell J.","Year":"1993","Title":"Contrasting Holocene sedimentary geologies of lower Daly River, northern Australia, and lower Sepik-Ramu, Papua New Guinea","Abstract_Description":"The estuarine plain of the macrotidal Daly River, in monsoonal northern Australia, is underlain by extensive mid-Holocene mangrove swamp sediments which accumulated during the last stages of Post-glacial sea-level rise. Sediment yield from the catchment is too low to account for the volume which accumulated during sea-level rise, and onshore transport is invoked. This is supported by radiocarbon ages and facies analysis of the transgressive sediment tract beneath the maximum flooding surface (MFS), and of the tract of vertical sedimentation which extends from the MFS to the surface of estuarine\/fluvial transition (the EFT). The EFT occurred about 5000 to 6000 BP throughout the estuarine plain. A contrasting situation exists in the lowland Holocene basin of the microtidal Sepik and Ramu rivers in Papua New Guinea, which derive sediment from highly tectonic catchments. A tectonic basin, which was a shallow brackish inland sea after Post-glacial transgression, is separated by a low divide from a deltaic plain. Progradation of the deltaic plain commenced about 3500 BP after regressive sedimentation eclipsed the inland sea in the tectonic basin. Contrasting organic facies, mangrove in the Daly and freshwater swamp deposits in the Sepik-Ramu, highlight differences between facies models of the two systems. Differences between fluvio-tidal regimes are reflected by the EFT, which is synchronous in the Daly and diachronous in the Sepik-Ramu, and possibly by the MFS which is diachronous in the Daly and may be synchronous in the Sepik-Ramu. \u00a9 1993.","JournalOrPublisher":"Sedimentary Geology","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"2023-04-03 00:00:00","DOI":"DOI:10.1016\/0037-0738(93)90020-6","URL":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/0037073893900206","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0035Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Conservation genomics","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Clugston J.A.R.; Ruhsam M.; Kenicer G.J.; Henwood M.; Milne R.; Nagalingum N.S.","Year":"2022","Title":"Conservation genomics of an Australian cycad Cycas calcicola, and the Absence of Key Genotypes in Botanic Gardens","Abstract_Description":"Understanding the genetic diversity of wild populations is fundamental to conserving species in-situ and ex-situ. To aid conservation plans and to inform ex-situ conservation, we examined the genetic diversity of the cycad Cycas calcicola (Cycadaceae). Samples were collected from wild populations in the Litchfield National Park and Katherine regions in the Northern Territory, Australia. Additional samples were obtained from botanic garden plants that were originally collected in the Katherine region, Daly River and Spirit Hills in the Northern Territory, Australia. Using RADseq we recovered 2271 informative genome-wide SNPs, revealing low to moderate levels of gene diversity (uHe = 0.037 to 0.135), very low levels of gene flow, and significant levels of inbreeding (mean FIS = 0.491). Population structure and multivariate analysis showed that populations fall into two genetic groups (Katherine vs Litchfield + Daly River + Spirit Hills). Genetic differentiation was twice as high between populations of the Katherine and Litchfield regions (FST ~ 0.1) compared to within these two regions (FST ~ 0.05). Increasing population fragmentation together with high levels of inbreeding and very little gene flow are concerning for the future adaptability of this species. The results indicated that the ex-situ collections (1) had significantly lower genetic diversity than the wild populations, and (2) only partly capture the genetic diversity present, particularly because the Litchfield National Park populations are not represented. We recommend that ex-situ collections be expanded to incorporate the genetic diversity found in Litchfield National Park and to increase the number of representatives from Daly River\/Spirit Hills, and that in-situ populations from the Katherine and Greater Litchfield regions be conserved as separate management units. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","JournalOrPublisher":"Conservation Genetics","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"3","DOI":"DOI:10.1007\/s10592-022-01428-8","URL":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10592-022-01428-8","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0036Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Fish ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Cook B.D.; Kennard M.J.; Real K.; Pusey B.J.; Hughes J.M.","Year":"2011","Title":"Landscape genetic analysis of the tropical freshwater fish Mogurnda mogurnda (Eleotridae) in a monsoonal river basin: Importance of hydrographic factors and population history","Abstract_Description":"We performed spatial genetic analyses, incorporating landscape genetic methods using microsatellite data and phylogeographic analyses using mtDNA data, to identify the principal factors that determine population heterogeneity of the tropical freshwater fish, Mogurnda mogurnda, in the Daly River, northern Australia. We tested the individual and interactive effects of several environmental variables on spatial genetic patterns, including metrics relating to connectivity (i.e. stream distance, maximum stream gradient and elevation), habitat size (i.e. mean annual discharge) and a categorical variable relating to population history, as determined by mtDNA phylogeographic analyses. The Daly River is geomorphologically and hydrologically complex, and M. mogurnda has life history traits that limit its dispersal potential at river basin scales. Thus, we predicted that variables relating to connectivity would be the most important landscape factors driving population structure of the species. Tree-based phylogeographic analyses indicated four divergent mtDNA lineages within M. mogurnda in the Daly River, although three of the lineages were sympatric in various combinations and did not correspond with microsatellite groups identified by assignment tests. The allopatric mtDNA lineage detected in the uppermost part of the catchment was also identified as being highly differentiated by the microsatellite data, strongly suggesting that it may be a cryptic species. This site was therefore excluded from subsequent landscape genetic analyses. Analyses of Molecular Variance indicated that M. mogurnda has a hierarchical population structure in the Daly River, thus supporting theoretical expectations that hierarchically arranged river habitats in dendritic systems impose hierarchal population structures on lotic species. All landscape genetic analyses rejected stream distance, and supported stream gradient, as the major determinant of spatial genetic variation in M. mogurnda in the Daly River. Support for elevation as a determinant of spatial genetic patterns differed among the landscape genetic methods. Several of the landscape genetic methods also indicate that population history, including secondary contact between divergent and formerly allopatric genetic lineages, has a strong influence on spatial genetic patterns within M. mogurnda in the Daly River. This study demonstrates the need to consider multiple environmental factors, especially factors relating to connectivity, and their interactions in spatial genetic analysis, rather than just geographic distance. Importantly, it demonstrates the need to account for population history and evolutionary divergences in landscape genetic analyses. \u00a9 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","JournalOrPublisher":"Freshwater Biology","Volume":"56","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1111\/j.1365-2427.2010.02527.x","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/j.1365-2427.2010.02527.x","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0037Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater","Subterranean"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Groundwater","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Cook P.G.; Favreau G.; Dighton J.C.; Tickell S.","Year":"2003","Title":"Determining natural groundwater influx to a tropical river using radon, chlorofluorocarbons and ionic environmental tracers","Abstract_Description":"Measurements of 222Rn, CFC- 11, CFC- 12, major ions and temperature of river water and springs are used to quantify rates of groundwater inflow to a tropical lowland river in the Northern Territory of Australia. Groundwater inflow results in increases in 222Rn concentrations within the river, but decreases in concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12, because the inflowing groundwater is relatively old. 222Rn, CFC-11 and CFC-12 concentrations are affected by gas exchange with the atmosphere, while ion concentrations are not. Additionally, CFC concentrations in the river appear to have been increased by air entrapment and dissolution during turbulent flow at river rapids. Because the regional groundwater is old, CFC concentrations in groundwater inflow are zero. In contrast, 222Rn and ion concentrations in the river are very sensitive to concentrations of these tracers in groundwater inflow. Numerical simulation of 222Rn, CFC-11 and CFC-12 stream concentrations allows the groundwater inflow rate, gas transfer velocity and air entrapment coefficient to be reasonably accurately constrained.

Ice-scour linked with provenance data indicate ice advance from the northeast. Additional ice-flow data from the west Kimberley and the Daly River area of Northern Territory are consistent and record a regional palaeoice-flow direction towards the southwest. Palaeocurrent data and facies relationships in the east Kimberley, however, suggest that sediment transport directions within the east Kimberley basin were influenced by a combination of ice-induced lithospheric flexure, pre-existing topography and modification of basin topography and sediment dispersal paths by ice-induced redistribution of debris. A basin evolution model incorporating these concepts within the framework of ice advance, retreat and marine inundation is proposed. Identification of regional ice-flow trends of this scale should ultimately prove a useful tool in testing possible palaeogeographic reconstructions of continent configurations in a post-Rodinian world. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Acoustic transmitters were implanted into 25 barramundi (420-1010-mm total length (TL); median 510mm TL) from freshwater reaches of the South Alligator River and their movements tracked over >2 years. 87Sr\/86Sr transect analysis was also conducted on otoliths of 67 barramundi from the Daly, Mary, South Alligator and Roper rivers.

Higher rates of movement occurred during the wet season and a minority of fish moved into the estuary during high flows. Otolith chemistry analyses revealed high diversity in salinity histories among individuals. We integrated the telemetry and otolith chemistry data to examine migration as a function of the stage of sexual development, and have proposed a revised life history model that identifies three migratory contingents.

We used radiotelemetry to examine diel patterns of habitat use by tracking the locations of 17 juvenile Sooty grunter (Hephaestus fuliginosus) over a 10-day period during the late dry season in a river in the wet\u2013dry tropics of northern Australia. Habitat use data were integrated with a hydrodynamic model to identify preferred hydraulic habitat and explore different river discharge scenarios to assess the potential effects of water abstraction on habitat availability. Sooty grunter exhibited a strong preference for shallow, fast flowing mesohabitat (riffles and runs). Hydraulic microhabitat preference was modelled using generalised additive mixed-effect models (GAMMs) and showed no significant difference in microhabitat selection between day and night. Habitat criteria developed from a combined day-night GAMM were defined as locations with velocities of 0.26\u20131.42 m s\u22121 and depths <0.69 m. Hydrodynamic modelling of river discharge scenarios in the study reach showed that the area of preferred habitat was highest at 8 m3 s\u22121, with large declines in habitat area under low flows (61% decline in habitat area at 0.5 m3 s\u22121 compared to the discharge of 2.8 m3 s\u22121 at the time of radio-tracking). While the study focusses on a single species, our findings demonstrate the broad applicability of radiotelemetry as a means of quantifying the diel hydraulic habitat requirements of riverine fish to support the objective determination of environmental flow regimes. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","JournalOrPublisher":"Ecohydrology","Volume":"14","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1002\/eco.2290","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/eco.2290","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0041Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater","Marine"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Fish ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Crook D.A.; Lacksen K.; King A.J.; Buckle D.J.; Tickell S.J.; Woodhead J.D.; Maas R.; Townsend S.A.; Douglas M.M.","Year":"2017","Title":"Temporal and spatial variation in strontium in a tropical river: Implications for otolith chemistry analyses of fish migration","Abstract_Description":"Analysis of otolith strontium isotope ratios (87Sr\/86Sr) is an increasingly utilized approach for studying fish migration.

Spatial variation in freshwater87Sr\/86Sr was high (range: 0.71612\u20130.78059), and there was strong seasonality in water87Sr\/86Sr, with highest values in the wet season. Temporal variation in water87Sr\/86Sr ratios is attributed to seasonal patterns in surface runoff from geological formations with radiogenic compositions versus input from groundwater aquifers interacting with less radiogenic formations. Temporal variation in water87Sr\/86Sr ratios precluded robust inference on movement within fresh water for both species, although movement across salinity gradients by diamond mullet was clearly identified.

Quantifying this uncertainty provides an understanding of the limitations of the estimates, and being able to reduce the uncertainty makes the recharge estimates more useful for water resources management. This paper describes the development of a method to constrain the uncertainty in upscaled recharge estimates using a rejection sampling procedure for baseflow and remotely sensed evapotranspiration data to constrain the lower and upper end of the recharge distribution, respectively. The recharge estimates come from probabilistic chloride mass-balance estimates from 3,575 points upscaled using regression kriging with rainfall, soils and vegetation as covariates. The method is successfully demonstrated for the 570,000-km2 Cambrian Limestone Aquifer in northern Australia. The method developed here is able to reduce the uncertainty in the upscaled chloride mass-balance estimates of recharge by nearly a third using data that are readily available. The difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles of unconstrained recharge across the aquifer was 31 mm\/yr (range 5\u201336 mm\/yr) which was reduced to 22 mm\/yr for the constrained case (9\u201331 mm\/yr). The spatial distribution of recharge was dominated by the spatial distribution of rainfall but was comparatively reduced in areas with denser vegetation or finer textured soils. Recharge was highest in the north-west in the Daly River catchment with a catchment average of 101 (61\u2013192) mm\/yr and lowest in the south-east Georgina River catchment with 6 (4\u201312) mm\/yr. \u00a9 2021, Crown.","JournalOrPublisher":"Hydrogeology Journal","Volume":"29","Issue":"4","DOI":"DOI:10.1007\/s10040-021-02323-1","URL":"\/documents\/0042Da-Crosbie-2021-Journal_Article.pdf","File_name":"0042Da-Crosbie-2021-Journal_Article.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0043Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Fish ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Davis A.M.; Pusey B.J.; Pearson R.G.","Year":"2012","Title":"Contrasting intraspecific dietary shifts in two terapontid assemblages from Australia's wet-dry tropics","Abstract_Description":"This study assessed the size-related patterns of dietary resource use in terapontid assemblages from two north Australian wet-dry tropical river systems exhibiting contrasting long-term flow regimes.

Because this toxic frog is novel to the Australian fauna, its introduction has impacted native fauna in a variety of ways. We anticipated a severe decline in the yellow-spotted monitor lizard (Varanus panoptes) associated with the arrival of cane toads along the Daly River, Northern Territory, and predicted a simultaneous impact on nest predation in the pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta) because the lizard is the chief predator of C. insculpta eggs at the site. We surveyed for monitors and cane toads for five years at two sites before and after the arrival of cane toads, and surveyed for turtle nest predation for three years before, and one year after, the arrival of the toads. Collectively, our data and observations, combined with unpublished reports, indicate that: (1) cane toads arrived at our study sites during the wet seasons of 2003-04 and 2004-05; (2) the lizard V. panoptes readily succumbs to cane toad toxins; (3) . panoptes has experienced a marked decline in relative population numbers coincident with the arrival of the toads at the site; and (4) V. panoptes has been reduced to such low numbers that it is currently no longer a significant predator of pig-nosed turtle eggs. \u00a9 CSIRO 2006.","JournalOrPublisher":"Wildlife Research","Volume":"33","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/WR05042","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/wr\/wr05042","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0048Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Riparian"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Doody J.S.; Sims R.A.; Letnic M.","Year":"2007","Title":"Environmental manipulation to avoid a unique predator: Drinking hole excavation in the agile wallaby, Macropus agilis","Abstract_Description":"The simplest way of avoiding an ambush predator is to entirely avoid the habitat in which it hunts. However, this strategy requires that the prey species find alternative, risk-free sources of essential resources. Herein we describe a novel strategy used by agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) to avoid saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) predation: the creation of risk-free sites to obtain water. We studied the anti-predator behaviour of agile wallabies for 3 yr during the dry season along the Daly River, Northern Territory, Australia. Wallabies excavated holes in the sand 0.5-18.0 m from the water's edge, and preferred to drink from these holes over drinking from the river. We determined a hierarchy of preferred drinking-site options for the wallabies: non-river sites: springs, puddles, excavated holes; and river sites: sites with cover, shallow water sites and deep water sites. Drinking holes were twice as far from the water's edge in a river stretch with high crocodile density (2\/km) than those in a stretch with low crocodile density (0.08\/km). However, site differences could also be explained by river bank morphology. Collectively, our findings indicate that agile wallabies excavate drinking holes to avoid crocodile predation. We contend that this behaviour represents environmental manipulation specifically to alter the risk associated with obtaining a key resource. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.","JournalOrPublisher":"Ethology","Volume":"113","Issue":"2","DOI":"DOI:10.1111\/j.1439-0310.2006.01298.x","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/j.1439-0310.2006.01298.x","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0049Da","Catchment":["Daly","Fitzroy","Gilbert","Northern Australia"],"State":["NT","QLD","QLD","Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Hydrology","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Duvert C; Lim, HS; Irvine, DJ; Bird, MI; Bass, AM; Tweed, SO; Hutley, LB; Munksgaard, NC","Year":"2022","Title":"Hydrological processes in tropical Australia: Historical perspective and the need for a catchment observatory network to address future development","Abstract_Description":"Study region: Tropical Australia.

We discuss the prominence of focused, episodic recharge in the replenishment of groundwater stores across the region. We also review how climate change and potential water resource development projects may alter the hydrology of northern Australian catchments.

Reach mapping and classification were conducted using the revised typology. The 12 major river types proposed were: (1) bedrock rivers; (2) bedrock-confined and -constrained rivers; (3) low sinuosity (straight) rivers; (4) meandering rivers; (5) wandering rivers; (6) anabranching rivers; (7) chains of ponds; (8) gullies; (9) floodouts; (10) lakes, swamps, billabongs and wetlands; (11) non-channelized valley floors; and (12) estuarine rivers. The 12 major river types were developed based on river reach mapping for more than 264 000\u00a0km2 of tropical Australian catchments. At scales larger than 1:250\u00a0000, subdivision of each major river type is recommended. In the Daly and Fitzroy catchments, confined and constrained rivers dominate, whereas in the Flinders and Fitzroy catchments, anabranching rivers dominate. The dominant river types need benchmarking with adequate numbers of control reaches so that channel changes induced by human and natural impacts can be measured by reference to the stability of these controls. Wandering rivers, floodouts and non-channelized valley floors were rare for the 1:250 000 channel network in northern Australia but need inclusion in national parks. \u00a9 2017 Commonwealth of Australia.

(2) To discuss causal processes in the flowering patterns of semelparous bamboos. Location: The entire range of B. arnhemica, in the monsoonal, tropical, northwest of the Northern Territory of Australia, mostly along watercourses. Methods: Landscape-scale flowering patterns were assessed by a combination of air, boat and ground survey in each year from 2000 to 2002. Areas that flowered prior to 2000, and those in which no flowering occurred, were also recorded, and historic records collated. At local scales, initiation of flowering, rates of die-off, and subsequent germination densities of seedlings were quantified by groundbased counts. Results: After an estimated 40-50 years of vegetative development, B. arnhemica flowered, seeded prolifically, then died. Flowering occurred synchronously within patches ranging from 0.002 to 3200 km2. One or more patches flowered in successive years from 1996 to 2002, forming a temporally-structured but spatially-chaotic flowering wave that affected c. 80% of the population. Synchronous flowering took the form of a flowering distribution in which over 95% of clumps within a patch initiated flowering in a central year, most of the remainder flowering the year before or after. Along the Daly River, an exception was observed in which 56% of clumps flowered in the peak year. Seedling densities were three orders of magnitude greater under clumps that flowered in the central rather than the leading year of the flowering distribution. Main conclusions: Synchrony is argued to be the primal state in semelparous bamboos, promoted by intense selection acting on a endogenous (genetic or biological) clock whose influence largely overrides that of the environment. A flowering wave may develop within an initially synchronous population when stochastic events interact with the biological clock without permanently altering the clock setting, producing an off-set patch. Off-set groups may only survive if sufficient individuals are off-set by the same amount at the same time and in the same vicinity so as to produce a new synchronously-flowering patch. This could be driven by two processes. Inter-year climatic variation may alter the biological clock's perception of time, producing off-sets at local or regional scales or even affecting entire populations. Severe environmental pressures may also force one-off changes to flowering schedules, as suggested by a severe flood event prior to flowering on the Daly River. A dynamic hypothesis for a wider range of bamboo flowering patterns is proposed in which synchronous flowering is fragmented and disrupted over time but renewed by allochronic speciation and dispersal.","JournalOrPublisher":"Journal Of Biogeography","Volume":"31","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1111\/j.1365-2699.2003.01057.x","URL":"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3554845","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0054Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Water quality","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Ganf GG; Rea, N","Year":"2007","Title":"Potential For Algal Blooms In Tropical Rivers Of The Northern Territory, Australia","Abstract_Description":"Rivers in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia are under pressure from increasing vegetation clearance, land use and nutrient run-off.

We report on the potential for tropical rivers to experience problems related to algal growth. NT rivers were found to have a low nutrient status and a viable inoculum of blue-green, brown and green algal communities. The growth response of these algal groups to nutrient enrichment via bioassays and pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) fluorometry measurements varied among rivers and the addition of N, P or N & P. However, the overwhelming findings were that all rivers had the potential to experience algal blooms with enrichment. Back-calculations based on the chlorophyll concentrations recorded in bioassay experiments and stoichiometric ratios of chlorophyll: nutrients suggest there are pools of biologically available organic forms of N and P in addition to inorganic forms. The role of river length in the development of algal blooms was investigated: the longer the river reach, the slower the flow, and the greater the availability of nutrients, the higher potential for algal blooms.

Two new extant species from tropical northern Australia are described, of which L. origolacus n. sp. has an extensive fossil record, particularly in non-marine phases of the Gulf of Carpentaria basin through most of the last Interglacial period (from approx. 130,000 years) to the present time. The other, L. dalyfluvialis n. sp., appears to be restricted to the Daly River in the Northern Territory. Both species are extremely abundant in certain fluviatile\/lacustrine habitats. Aspects of the ecology of each species are discussed. L. dalyfluvialis, though normally infaunal and endobyssate, is capable of rapid movement and active burrowing. Such behaviour, while highly unusual for the family, is presumably necessary for survival in major rivers prone to sudden flooding during the monsoon season. \u00a9 2010 Malacological Society of Australasia & Society for the Study of Molluscan Diversity.","JournalOrPublisher":"Molluscan Research","Volume":"30","Issue":"3","DOI":"DOI:10.11646\/mr.30.3.5 ","URL":"https:\/\/www.mapress.com\/mrs\/article\/view\/mr.30.3.5","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0057Da","Catchment":["Daly","Fitzroy","Ord","Northern Australia"],"State":["NT","QLD","WA","Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Hamilton SK; Gehrke, PC","Year":"2005","Title":"Australia's Tropical River Systems: Current Scientific Understanding And Critical Knowledge Gaps For Sustainable Management","Abstract_Description":"Australia's tropical river systems are poorly understood in comparison with Australia's temperate freshwater and tropical marine systems.

Key research issues include improved quantification of available water resources, hydrological, biogeochemical and ecological linkages at systems scales, understanding and valuing ecosystem processes and services, and projecting the effects of long-term climate change.

These include spatial connectivity or propagation of threats along stream networks, essential to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem processes and the biodiversity they sustain. However, these peculiarities make conservation recommendations difficult to implement as they often require considering large areas that cannot be managed under conventional conservation schemes (e.g. strict protection). To facilitate the implementation of conservation in freshwater systems, a multizoning approach with different management zones subject to different management regimes was proposed. So far, this approach has only been used in post hoc exercises where zones were allocated using expert criteria. This might undermine the cost-effectiveness of conservation recommendations, because both the allocation and extent of these zones have never been optimized using the principles of systematic planning. Here, we demonstrate how to create a catchment multizone plan by using a commonly applied tool in marine and terrestrial realms. We first test the capability of Marxan with Zones to address problems in rivers by using a simulated example and then apply the findings to a real case in the Daly River catchment, northern Australia. We also demonstrate how to address common conservation planning issues, such as accounting for threats or species-specific connectivity needs in this multizone framework, and evaluate their effects on the spatial distribution and extent of different zones. We found that by prioritizing the allocation of zones subject to different management regimes, we could minimize the total area in need of strict conservation by a twofold factor. This reduction can be further reduced (threefold) when considering species' connectivity needs. The integration of threats helped reduce the average threats of areas selected by a twofold factor. Synthesis and applications. Catchment zoning can help refine conservation recommendations and enhance cost-effectiveness by prescribing different management regimes informed by ecological needs or distribution of threats. Reliable information on these factors is a key to ensure soundness of planning. Freely available software can be used to implement the approach we demonstrate here.

The adequate integration of ESs needs careful consideration of potential trade-offs, however, especially between provisioning services and biodiversity conservation (e.g. the potentially negative consequences of agricultural water extraction within areas important for the maintenance of biodiversity). These trade-offs have been overlooked in systematic spatial planning to date, especially in freshwater systems. marxan with zones was used to identify priority areas for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity (139 species of freshwater fish, turtles, and waterbirds) and the provision of freshwater ESs in the Daly River, northern Australia. Four different surrogates for ESs were mapped, including those potentially incompatible with conservation goals (i.e. groundwater provision for agriculture and recreational fisheries) and those that are more compatible with conservation (i.e. flood regulation by riparian forests; provision of perennial water). The spatial allocation of multiple management zones was prioritized: (i) three conservation zones, aiming to represent freshwater biodiversity and compatible ESs to enhance co-benefits; and (ii) two production zones, where access to provisioning ESs could be granted. The representation of ESs obtained when using the multi-zoning approach was compared with that achieved with a single management zone approach. The comparison was performed across different representation targets. Different results were found with low and high targets for ESs. With low targets (<25% of all ESs), the multi-zoning approach achieved up to 53% more co-benefits than the single-zone approach. With high targets (>25% of all ESs), the trade-offs avoided were more evident, with up to 56% less representation of incompatible ESs within conservation zones. Multi-zone planning could help decision makers respond better to the increasingly complex catchment management context, caused by an increasing demand for provisioning services and a diminishing availability of resources, as well as manage and plan for challenges in other realms facing similar problems.

An extensive literature has reported a decline in efficiency of conservation outputs when planning at small spatial scales or when using large planning units. However, other key issues remain, such as the grain size used to represent the spatial distribution of conservation features. Here, we evaluate the effect of grain size of species distribution data versus size of planning units on a set of performance measures describing efficiency (ratio of area where species are represented\/total area needed), rate of commission errors (species erroneously expected to occur), representativeness (proportion of species achieving the target) and a novel measure of overall conservation uncertainty (integrating commission errors and uncertainty in the actual locations where species occur). We compared priority areas for the conservation of freshwater fish in the Daly River basin (northern Australia). Our study demonstrates that the effect of grain size of species distribution data was more important than planning unit size on conservation planning performance, with an increase in commission errors up to 80% and conservation uncertainty over 90% when coarse data were used. This was more pronounced for rare than common species, where the mismatch between coarse representations of biodiversity patterns and the smaller areas of actual occupancy of species was more evident. Special attention should be paid to the high risk of misallocation of limited budgets when planning in heterogeneous or disturbed environments, where biodiversity is patchily distributed, or when planning for conservation of rare species. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","JournalOrPublisher":"Biological Conservation","Volume":"147","Issue":"1","DOI":"DOI:10.1016\/j.biocon.2012.01.020","URL":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S000632071200033X","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0061Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Estuarine"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Hydrology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Higgins P.A.; Palmer J.G.; Rao M.P.; Andersen M.S.; Turney C.S.M.; Johnson F.","Year":"2022","Title":"Unprecedented High Northern Australian Streamflow Linked To An Intensification Of The Indo-Australian Monsoon","Abstract_Description":"Streamflow in Australia\u2019s northern rivers has been steadily increasing since the 1970s, most likely due to increased intensity in the Indo-Australian monsoon. However, because of limited data availability, it is hard to assess this recent trend and therefore contextualize potential future climatic changes. In this study, we used a network of 63 precipitation-sensitive tree-ring chronologies from the Indo-Australian and Asian monsoon regions to reconstruct streamflow in the Daly catchment in the Northern Territory of Australia from 1413 to 2005 CE. We used a novel wavelet-based method to transform the variance structure of the tree-ring chronologies to better match the hydroclimate prior to reconstruction with a hierarchical Bayesian regression model. Our streamflow reconstruction accounts for 72%\u201378% of the variance in the instrumental period and closely matches both historical flood events and independent proxy records, increasing confidence in its validity. We find that while streamflow has been increasing since the 1800s, the most recent 40-year period is unprecedented in the last \u223c600\u00a0years. Comparison to an independent coral-based streamflow record shows regional coherency in this trend. Extreme high flows were found to be linked to La Ni\u00f1a events, but we found no significant relationship between streamflow and El Ni\u00f1o events, or streamflow and other regional climatic drivers. More work is therefore needed to understand the drivers of the recent streamflow increase, but, regardless of the cause, water managers should be aware of the paleoclimatic context before making decisions on water allocations. \u00a9 2022.

Stanner is a key figure in the history of Australian anthropology and Aboriginal affairs. A student of both Radcliffe-Brown and Malinowski, Stanner undertook anthropological work from the 1930s in north Australia, Africa and briefly in the Pacific.

A selective reading of the notes Stanner made in Radcliffe-Brown's lectures, his field diaries and unpublished master's thesis provides the main materials for my discussion. Prior to travelling to the Daly River Stanner had intended to make a study of regional social organisation. The situation he encountered proved to be much more conducive to a description and analysis of 'culture contact'. The unpublished writings Stanner produced in his attempt to make sense of this complex social field reveal an attempt to transcend some fundamental aspects of anthropological theorising of the day, and to produce a new conceptual model for taking hold of social, transformation. The argument is presented that in reading these materials we gain a glimpse of an important early attempt to develop an intercultural analysis of Aboriginal Australia.","JournalOrPublisher":"Oceania","Volume":"75","Issue":"3","DOI":"DOI:10.1002\/j.1834-4461.2005.tb02880.x","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/epdf\/10.1002\/j.1834-4461.2005.tb02880.x","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0063Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Geology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"HOWARD PF","Year":"1990","Title":"The Distribution Of Phosphatic Facies In The Georgina, Wiso And Daly River Basins, Northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"The lithological logging and chemical testing of cuttings from some 600 water bores and Bureau of Mineral Resources stratigraphic holes, together with the modelling of aeromagnetic, gravity and elevation data, have defined a carbonate-siltstone-chert phosphatic lithofacies of Middle Cambrian age. This in turn has led to the recognition of two new phosphorite deposits, the deposition of which was related to the basement configuration and its depth. The phosphatic lithofacies, which have been followed entirely in the subsurface, occur as belts peripheral to and within the Georgina, Wiso and Daly River Basins. These phosphatic belts have an average width of 32 km, a thickness of 10 to 190 m, and have been traced over a distance of 2,100 km. Of the newly discovered phosphorite deposits, the Lady Judith in the Wiso Basin rests on volcanic rocks and interdigitates with carbonates of the Montejinni Limestone, while the Ammaroo belt in the southwestern portion of the Georgina Basin is contained within a depression bounded by limestones of the Arthur Creek Formation. The phosphatic sediments are believed to have been deposited primarily as an Ordian Middle Cambrian event in the west with a \u2018younging\u2019 transition through Ordian and\/or Early Templetonian to Late Templetonian in the southeast. The basins are extensional, exhibiting a series of broad downwarps crossed by peripheral aulacogens, grabens, half grabens formed in the Late Proterozoic and modified subsequently by the development of plateaux, narrow horst blocks and adjacent deeps during the Middle Cambrian along basin-dividing arches. The basement to the shallow-water phosphatic lithofacies consists of Proterozoic sediment or Early Cambrian volcanic plateaux or peripheral sloping platforms which in the Brunette Sub-basin have present elevations of 0\u2013300 m ASL.

These resources are part of a socially and culturally significant landscape. Using data collected from household surveys across two catchments in northern Australia, the Daly River, Northern Territory (NT) and the Fitzroy River, Western Australia (WA), we describe indigenous aquatic resource use patterns. The former is a perennial system with extensive vegetated wetlands that can remain inundated for 4-5 months, while the latter can cease to flow during the winter dry season (May-October) and its floods usually last for weeks. Subsistence strategies depend on seasonal availability of a wide array of aquatic species and are attuned to the life histories and movement patterns of key species, such as Long-necked Turtle (Chelodina rugosa) and Magpie Goose (Anseranas semipalmata). Indigenous households harvested resources from different habitats. Our results show a clear progression from use of the main river channel shortly after the wet season to use of billabongs late in the dry season in the Daly River, and a constant reliance on the main river channel and tributaries in the Fitzroy River. Difference in the main species utilised appears strongly related to habitat use, with four of the five most commonly harvested in the Daly catchment being non-fish species associated with billabong habitats. Commonly harvested species from the Fitzroy catchment included small bodied species used as bait and two popular food species, Black Bream (Hephaestus jenkinsi) and Catfish (Neoarius spp.). Results suggest that indigenous subsistence strategies are vulnerable to changes in the natural systems that provide the \"ecosystem goods,\" particularly annual inundation of floodplains that drives productivity and provides habitat for some key species. Water resource developments, such as river regulation and increased abstraction for irrigated agriculture, could adversely affect a highly valued customary component of the indigenous economies of tropical Australia. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","JournalOrPublisher":"Human Ecology","Volume":"40","Issue":"6","DOI":"DOI:10.1007\/s10745-012-9518-z","URL":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10745-012-9518-z","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0066Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Jackson S.E.; Douglas M.M.; Kennard M.J.; Pusey B.J.; Huddleston J.; Harney B.; Liddy L.; Liddy M.; Liddy R.; Sullivan L.; Huddleston B.; Banderson M.; McMah A.; Allsop Q.","Year":"2014","Title":"We Like To Listen To Stories About Fish: Integrating Indigenous Ecological And Scientific Knowledge To Inform Environmental Flow Assessments","Abstract_Description":"Studies that apply indigenous ecological knowledge to contemporary resource management problems are increasing globally; however, few of these studies have contributed to environmental water management.

We used a large scale survey of freshwater biota from 67 sites in three catchments (Daly River, Northern Territory; Fitzroy River, Western Australia; and the Mitchell River, Queensland) in Australia's wet-dry tropics and analysed stable isotopes of carbon (\u03b4 13C) to search for broad patterns in resource use by consumers in conjunction with known and measured indices of connectivity, the duration of floodplain inundation, and dietary choices (i.e. stomach contents of fish). Regression analysis of biofilm \u03b4 13C against consumer \u03b4 13C, as an indicator of reliance on local food sources (periphyton and detritus), varied depending on taxa and catchment. The carbon isotope ratios of benthic invertebrates were tightly coupled to those of biofilm in all three catchments, suggesting assimilation of local resources by these largely nonmobile taxa. Stable C isotope ratios of fish, however, were less well-linked to those of biofilm and varied by catchment according to hydrological connectivity; the perennially flowing Daly River with a long duration of floodplain inundation showed the least degree of coupling, the seasonally flowing Fitzroy River with an extremely short flood period showed the strongest coupling, and the Mitchell River was intermediate in connectivity, flood duration and consumer-resource coupling. These findings highlight the high mobility of the fish community in these rivers, and how hydrological connectivity between habitats drives patterns of consumer-resource coupling. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

The objective of this work was to compare two riparian condition assessment approaches, the Tropical Rapid Appraisal of Riparian Condition (TRARC) method developed for rapid on-ground assessment of the environmental condition of savanna riparian zones and an image based riparian condition monitoring scheme. Measurements derived from these two approaches were compared and correlated. The sample representativeness of the TRARC method was evaluated and the cost-effectiveness and suitability for multi-temporal analysis of the two approaches were assessed. Two high spatial resolution multi-spectral QuickBird satellite images captured in 2004 and 2005 and coincident field data covering sections of the Daly River in the Northern Territory, Australia were used in this work. Both field and image data were processed to map indicators of riparian zone condition including percentage canopy cover, organic litter on the ground, canopy continuity, tree clearing, bank stability, and flood damage. Spectral vegetation indices, image segmentation, and supervised classification were used to produce riparian health indicator maps. QuickBird image data were used to examine if the spatial distribution of TRARC transects provided a representative sample of ground based estimates of riparian health indicators. Covering approximately 3% of the study area, the sample mean of the TRARC estimates of individual indicators of riparian zone condition were in most cases within 20% of the global mean derived from the whole imaged riparian area. The cost-effectiveness of the image based approach was compared to that of the ground based TRARC method. Results showed that the TRARC method was more cost-effective at spatial scales from 1 km to 200 km of river in relatively homogeneous riparian zones along rivers with only one channel, while image based assessment becomes more feasible at regional scales (200-2000 km of river). A change detection analysis demonstrated that image data can provide detailed information on gradual change, while the TRARC method is less suited for multi-temporal analysis due to the ranked data format, which inhibits precise detection of change. However, results from both methods were considered to complement each other for single date assessment of riparian zones if used at appropriate spatial scales. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The selected two ecosystems are woodland savanna in Daly River and eucalyptus forest in Tumbarumba. The WAVES model was first manually calibrated and validated against soil water content measured by cosmic-ray probe and evapotranspiration measured with eddy flux techniques. The calibrated model was then used to simulate long-term water balance components with observed climate data at two sites. Analyzing the trends and variabilities of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is used to interpret the climate change impacts on ecosystem water bal-ance. The results showed that the WAVES model can accurately simulate soil water content and evapotranspiration at two study sites. Over the period of 1950\u20132015, annual evapotranspiration at both sites showed decreasing trends (1.988 mm year1 in Daly and 0.381 mm year1 in Tumbarumba), whereas annual runoff in Daly increased significantly (5.870 mm year1) and decreased in Tumbarumba (\u20130.886 mm year1). It can be concluded that the annual runoff trends are consistent with the rainfall trends, whereas trends in annual evapotran-spiration are influenced by both rainfall and potential evapotranspiration.

Northern Australia\u2019s freshwater resources, particularly dry season river flows, are being increasingly modified to support human development, potentially threatening aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, including fish. More information is urgently needed on the ecology of fishes in this region, including their habitat requirements, to support water policy and management to ensure future sustainable development. This study used electrofishing and habitat survey methods to quantify the dry season habitat use of 20 common freshwater fish taxa in the Daly River in Australia\u2019s wet-dry tropics. Of twenty measured habitat variables, water depth and velocity were the two most important factors discriminating fish habitat use for the majority of taxa. Four distinct fish habitat guilds were identified, largely classified according to depth, velocity and structural complexity. Ontogenetic shifts in habitat use were also observed in three species. This study highlights the need to maintain dry season river flows that support a diversity of riverine mesohabitats for freshwater fishes. In particular, shallow fast-flowing areas provided critical nursery and refuge habitats for some species, but are vulnerable to water level reductions due to water extraction. By highlighting the importance of a diversity of habitats for fishes, this study assists water managers in future decision making on the ecological risks of water extractions from tropical rivers, and especially the need to maintain dry season low flows to protect the habitats of native fish. \u00a9 2019, The Author(s).","JournalOrPublisher":"Scientific Reports","Volume":"9","Issue":"1","DOI":"DOI:10.1038\/s41598-019-41287-x","URL":"\/documents\/0072Da-Keller-2019-Journal_Article.pdf","File_name":"0072Da-Keller-2019-Journal_Article.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0073Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Fish ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"King A.J.; Doidge C.; Buckle D.; Tyler K.J.","Year":"2020","Title":"Preliminary Evidence Of Spawning Phenologies Of Freshwater Fish In A Wet-Dry Tropical River: The Importance Of Both Wet And Dry Seasons","Abstract_Description":"Wet-dry tropical rivers are characterised by highly predictable, yet highly variable, seasonal flow regimes. The wet season is often regarded as an important period of ecosystem productivity, dispersal and connectivity, and also for freshwater-fish spawning and recruitment. However, few studies have examined fish spawning across hydrological seasons in these rivers. We conducted a pilot study to determine (1) the temporal occurrence (and hence spawning period), and (2) the suitability of standard sampling methods of young fish in the Daly River, Northern Territory, Australia. Fish spawned throughout the year, with spawning phenologies varying substantially among species. The highest diversity and abundance of young fish occurred during the wet season, although early life stages of a high number of species were also present in the dry-season and transition periods. A high number of species spawned all year round, whereas other species had very discrete spawning periods. Three of the four sampling methods tested were successful in catching early life stages and should be employed in future studies. The present study highlighted that all hydrological seasons in the wet-dry tropics are important for fish spawning, and has important implications for future research on the drivers of spawning patterns, and for predicting the effects of flow modifications on freshwater fishes of the wet-dry tropics. \u00a9 2020 CSIRO.","JournalOrPublisher":"Marine And Freshwater Research","Volume":"71","Issue":"2","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/MF18458","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/MF\/MF18458","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0074Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"King AJ; Townsend, SA; Douglas, MM; Kennard, MJ","Year":"2015","Title":"Implications Of Water Extraction On The Low-Flow Hydrology And Ecology Of Tropical Savannah Rivers: An Appraisal For Northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"Balancing the freshwater needs of humans and ecosystems is a fundamental challenge for the management of rivers worldwide. River regulation and water extraction can affect all components of the natural flow regime, yet few studies have investigated the effects on the low-flow end of the hydrograph. Low-flow periods are hydrologically distinctive and ecologically important, varying in nature among climatic zones. Tropical savannah rivers are characterized by highly seasonal and predictable flow regimes, but with high interannual variation in the magnitude, timing, and duration of low flows. Many tropical savannah rivers are relatively intact, especially in northern Australia, but many are now receiving increasing attention for water-resource development through surface- and groundwater extraction. We identified the hydroecological effects of water extraction on 3 phases of the seasonal flow regime: the wet-dry transition, dry season, and dry-wet season transition for perennial and intermittent rivers in tropical savannah climates. We propose a conceptual model and 7 predictions that describe the ecological implications of dry-season water extraction in tropical savannah river systems worldwide. The predictions address: 1) connectivity, 2) availability of in-stream habitat, 3) dry-season persistence of in-channel refugia, 4) water quality during dry-wet and wet-dry transition periods, 5) decoupling of wet- and dry-season flows, and the cumulative effects on 6) groundwater-dependent species and 7) whole-ecosystem shifts. We used northern Australia as a case study to review the current level of evidence in support of these predictions and their potential ecological consequences, and used this review to propose key priorities for future research that are globally applicable.","JournalOrPublisher":"Freshwater Science","Volume":"34","Issue":"2","DOI":"DOI:10.1086\/681302","URL":"https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/10.1086\/681302","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0075Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Soils","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Lal R.; Fifield L.K.; Tims S.G.; Wasson R.J.; Howe D.","Year":"2020","Title":"A Study Of Soil Erosion Rates Using 239Pu, In The Wet-Dry Tropics Of Northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"The Daly River drains a large (52500 km2) and mainly undisturbed catchment in the Australian wet\u2013dry tropics. The basin landscapes are mantled by a thick veneer of kandosol soil which has developed under varying rates of erosion, uplift, bedrock type and climate and has been identified as being suitable for agriculture. Commencement of large scale clearing and cropping since 2002 have raised concerns about the increased loss of top soil from the land clearing and cultivation activities adjacent to the Daly River. This study was undertaken to determine the modern soil loss rates which can be used to develop a sustainable soil conservation strategy for this catchment. 239Pu, released in the 1950s and 1960s by atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, is used to obtain a quantitative assessment of recent rates of soil loss. Soil cores 30\u201340 cm deep have been collected from fields with various land uses including peanut and hay cropping and cattle grazing. Cores taken from undisturbed and unburnt areas in open eucalypt woodland have been used as reference sites. The soil loss rates have been established by comparing the excess or deficiency of the 239Pu tracer over that of the reference sites. Since land use practices in the catchment are similar, it is likely that the measured soil loss rates are indicative of soil loss rates over the Daly Basin as well.

Due to agricultural practices, modern soil loss rates can be significantly higher than long-term soil formation rates, but establishing soil formation rates has proved to be a difficult problem.

This long-term rate at which soil is being lost can be determined using the cosmogenic tracer Be-10, created in spallation of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen by cosmic rays.

Clearing and cropping since 2002 have raised concerns about possible increased sediment input into the river and motivated this study of its fine sediment sources. Using Pu-239 as a tracer it is shown that the fine sediments originate mainly from erosion by gullying and channel change. Although the results also indicate that the surface soil contribution to the river channel sediments from sheet erosion has increased to 5-22% for the Daly River and 7-28% for the Douglas River (a tributary of the Daly River) in 2009 vs. 3-6% for the Daly River and 4-9% for the Douglas River in 2005. This excess top soil likely originates from the cleared land adjacent to the Daly River since 2005.

Groundwater was a significant source of water for plant transpiration, probably accounting for more than 50% of the water transpired during the dry season. Groundwater use occurred either when trees used water from the capillary fringe or when low \u03a8m induced by soil water uptake lifted groundwater in the vadose zone. Several water use strategies were inferred within the riparian plant community. Melaleuca argentea W. Fitzg and Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn. appeared to be obligate phreatophytes as they used groundwater almost exclusively and were associated with riverbanks and lower terraces with shallow (<5 m) water tables. Several species appeared to be facultative phreatophytes (including Cathorium umbellatum (Vahl.) Kosterm. and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth.) and tended to rely more heavily on soil water with increased elevation in the riparian zone. The levee-bound Corymbia bella K.D. Hill and L.A.S. Johnson mostly used soil water and is either a facultative phreatophyte or a non-phreatophyte. The temporal variability in groundwater utilisation by the trees is unclear because the study focused on the end of the dry season only. A decline in the regional water table as a result of groundwater pumping may affect the health of riparian zone vegetation in the Daly River because groundwater use is significant during the dry season. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the process, other types of ecosystem services are often unintentionally lost as illustrated by the associated decline in biodiversity, increased soil erosion and emission of greenhouse gases. In 2003, the Northern Territory state government in Australia promulgated a moratorium on the clearing of native vegetation on freehold land in the Douglas-Daly river catchment, an area experiencing increasing pressure from agricultural development. The moratorium was intended to limit the rate and extent of land-clearing for a period of time so that informed policy could be concurrently developed to guide future land-clearing and minimise negative impacts. Under the moratorium, land-clearing required a permit and had to conform to broad guidelines; clearing was confined to freehold land, was prohibited in close proximity to wetlands, rivers and rainforest to safeguard water quality, and there were prescribed limits on percentages cleared by property, vegetation type, sub-catchment, and the whole catchment. Remotely sensed data (1977-2011) were used to explore the effectiveness of the moratorium. The analysis shows that, during moratorium years (2002-2009), clearing rates accelerated rather than slowed in the moratorium area and was mostly (81%) conducted without the required permits. The extent of land cleared after the moratorium was declared, and the fallow nature of some of this land a decade later, suggests that much of the land-clearing may have been completed in anticipation of stricter future controls. The moratorium failed because it was not formally legislated and was too broadly defined. Consequently, the non-binding nature of the land-clearing guidelines, and the absence of systematic monitoring of land cover change or penalties for clearing land without a permit, led to uninformed and uncontrolled clearing. This paper demonstrates that effective policy is only as good as its level of implementation.","JournalOrPublisher":"Rangeland Journal","Volume":"37","Issue":"4","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/RJ15014","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/RJ\/RJ15014","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0081Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Leigh C","Year":"2013","Title":"Dry-Season Changes In Macroinvertebrate Assemblages Of Highly Seasonal Rivers: Responses To Low Flow, No Flow And Antecedent Hydrology","Abstract_Description":"Highly seasonal rivers can experience extended low flow, and often dry, periods. Macroinvertebrate and flow data were used to explore hypotheses on the effects of antecedent hydrology and the low-flow, dry-season period on macroinvertebrate assemblages in northern Australia. Composition differed between early and late dry seasons. Taxa were more sensitive to water quality and more rheophilous in the early dry season when their habitats were lotic than when habitats later became lentic. As flow magnitudes in the antecedent dry season and on the sampling day increased, the habitats became more oxygenated and, in turn, macroinvertebrate richness increased. Higher wet-season flow magnitudes, flow variability and rates of fall were correlated with lower richness in the following dry season. Alteration of the flow-disturbance regime that increases the likelihood of flow cessation in macroinvertebrate habitats, or extends the duration of the dry season beyond that previously experienced in these highly seasonal systems, may alter the resistance and resilience of assemblages such that the seasonal decline and recovery of biodiversity may no longer be so reliable. Given the projected increase in low-flow incidence in many regions of the world, future research needs to examine the effects of reduced flow, flow cessation and stream drying as multiple, interacting stressors on stream biota.","JournalOrPublisher":"Hydrobiologia","Volume":"703","Issue":"1","DOI":"DOI:10.1007\/s10750-012-1347-y","URL":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10750-012-1347-y","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0082Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Biodiversity","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"LeSouef J.C.; Tindale N.B.","Year":"1970","Title":"A New Subspecies Of Virachola Smilis (Hewitson) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) From Northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"Virachola smilis dalyensis ssp. n. is described from the Daly River Crossing, south of Darwin, and from Stuart Point, east of Darwin, in the Northern Territory.

The recovery of the C. porosus population has been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of 'problem crocodiles' that represent a threat to people in freshwater and marine habitats. Despite the implications for human safety, little is known about C. porosus populations in the freshwater reaches of rivers, well upstream of tidal influence. In this study, we examined the density and body-size structure of C. porosus populations in three freshwater rivers using a combination of data from spotlight and helicopter surveys conducted between the 1980s and 2005, and the inland extent of C. porosus using distribution records in the Northern Territory. Since the 1980s, the density of C. porosus in upstream, freshwater reaches of the Daly and Roper rivers has increased, as has the inland extent of C. porosus on the Daly River. Although C. porosus was not detected in spotlight surveys of the Victoria River, helicopter survey and anecdotal records indicate that C. porosus was present after 1989. In all, 52.1% of the crocodiles sighted in spotlight surveys were 2.1-3.4 m long. Distribution records show that C. porosus occurs up to 235 km inland and at elevations of up to 126 m above sea level. The potential distribution of C. porosus is likely to be similar to that of barramundi (Lates calcarifer), a readily identifiable diadromous fish that must spawn in estuarine waters and occurs at elevations of up to 178 m above sea level. Because the density and inland extent of C. porosus in freshwater rivers is likely to increase, it is recommended that: (1) programs communicating crocodile awareness use the linkage between the presence of barramundi and the potential presence of C. porosus; (2) that crocodile warning signs be erected in upstream areas within the potential range of C. porosus; (3) that research be conducted on developing techniques to detect and exclude C. porosus from swimming areas; and (4) that widespread systematic surveys be undertaken to document the inland extent of C. porosus. \u00a9 CSIRO 2006.","JournalOrPublisher":"Wildlife Research","Volume":"33","Issue":"7","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/WR05090","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/WR\/WR05090","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0084Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Conservation management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Linke S.; Kennard M.J.; Hermoso V.; Olden J.D.; Stein J.; Pusey B.J.","Year":"2012","Title":"Merging Connectivity Rules And Large-Scale Condition Assessment Improves Conservation Adequacy In River Systems","Abstract_Description":"Conservation adequacy is defined as the ability of conservation measures to sustain biodiversity. Although river network connectivity is important for maintaining key ecological processes and ensuring persistence of biodiversity, it also facilitates the propagation of threats along river networks, which may compromise the sustainability of freshwater biodiversity and therefore conservation adequacy. This study aims to introduce two modifications to river conservation planning related to connectivity and catchment condition that together can improve the adequacy of the priority areas identified. This will establish an operational framework for end-users, such as policy makers and NGOs. We operationalize the connectivity framework that has recently emerged in systematic river conservation planning by using a GIS coding system for catchment location in the conservation software package marxan. Additionally, we use a landscape measure of catchment disturbance to direct the conservation plan to the least-disturbed area while still meeting targets for the conservation of fish species used as surrogates for overall biodiversity in our study catchment, the Daly River in northern Australia. This proxy for condition aggregates information on land-use, extractive industries, point-source pollution, and water infrastructure. We successfully modelled the distribution of 39 fish species based on GIS-derived landscape descriptors (most important descriptors were; discharge, distance to river mouth, geology and conductivity). Results from the systematic planning analysis identified a portfolio of watersheds that delivered close to optimal upstream protection with around 4700 stream kilometres (30% of the total network). When using upstream disturbance as an extra penalty, most of the network stayed intact; however, a replacement area was found for a major tributary, which only added an extra 1% of the stream network to the total area. Synthesis and applications. Improving conservation adequacy by accounting for upstream connectivity and condition using this easy-to-implement framework and software package has the potential to facilitate further application of systematic methods in river conservation planning. Furthermore, integrating condition as a discounting factor can also improve conservation adequacy in a broad range of environments (including terrestrial and marine), while not necessarily increasing the management costs. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

The latter frequently occurs in various lineages of freshwater gastropods, among them the \"marsupial\" Thiaridae with a pantropical distribution including Australia. Here the family was found to comprise at least 11 species, of which five are endemic to the continent. Of those two are highly restricted to only the central northern most region, viz. Melasma onca and Sermyla venustula. In contrast, \"Thiara\" australis reveals a wider range in Australia's monsoon tropics. Brood pouch contents of these three thiarids are analysed here in order to infer details of their reproductive modes in relation to the geographic origin of individual populations, seasonality and the biometry of their shells. We found pronounced species-specific differences in the reproductive modes of all three thiarids, with M. onca having significantly more progeny in the brood pouch compared to S. venustula and\"Thiara\" australis. At the same time, its progeny are smaller and hatchlings are less advanced than in the latter two species. In addition, we report drainage-based intraspecific differences in the first two species. Accordingly, the head-water region of the Roper River, which drains into the Gulf of Carpentaria, apparently provides better environmental conditions that allow both M. onca and S. venustula to produce more progeny with an increased shell height as compared to popoulations from other drainages within the two species' ranges. We suggest, in accordance with earlier studies, to differentiate more than only one mode within eu-viviparous reproductive strategies in thiarids. Studying the influence of various factors potentially correlated with interspecific as well as intraspecific differences in their reproductive biology, such as female shell size and drainage specific habitat, we show that Australian thiarids are more flexible and adaptable than previously known. \u00a9 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

One such topical area of development is the Daly River Basin. The Daly River and its tributaries are seen as potential sources of water to sustain future agriculture in the area. In order to ensure that over-abstraction is avoided and the natural ecological water requirements of the area are met, ecohydraulic investigations are being conducted. This paper describes the development of a dry season hydrodynamic model of one of the major tributaries to the Daly River, the Katherine River. The development of such models, when coupled with data describing the aquatic biota of a river, may enable the correlation of species to habitats and assess the impact on those habitats caused by water abstraction. This specific model, spanning a 9km reach 10km downstream of Katherine, was created to assist in an aquatic ecological study being conducted by the Northern Territory Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts. This modelling goal was achieved through the creation of a 2-D depth averaged finite element hydrodynamic model in RMA-10. This model was calibrated and verified successfully for a relatively high flow rate of 13.5m3s-1.

A finite element hydrodynamic and sediment transport model of a 10km long reach of river channel and floodplain has been created to investigate the likely cause of channel instability. Morphological changes within the channel during overbank flows are extremely varied but do indicate distinct infilling of pool sections and erosion of river banks.

As part of this project, efforts are underway to characterise the flow regime of streams within this mostly undisturbed, and relatively data-limited, region in order to be in a position to properly assess the impacts of potential development. In general, the tropical rivers region experiences a distinct wet season from October to April, and a dry season for the remainder of the year. Stream flow, as a consequence, is highly seasonal. Long-term discharge records from streams within three relatively well-gauged catchments - Daly (NT), Fitzroy (WA) and Flinders (Qld) rivers - have been analysed to classify streams into flow regime units. Hydrological variables based on flow variability, flood regime and intermittency, were derived for the complete record of each stream.

These markers will be now available for future studies of population structure across its natural range and to assist in management as well as future conservation. \u00a9 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","JournalOrPublisher":"Conservation Genetics Resources","Volume":"6","Issue":"4","DOI":"DOI:10.1007\/s12686-014-0271-z","URL":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12686-014-0271-z","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0091Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Soils","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Nott J.","Year":"1994","Title":"Long-Term Landscape Evolution In The Darwin Region And Its Implications For The Origin Of Landsurfaces In The North Of The Northern Territory","Abstract_Description":"The development of landsurfaces in the north of the Northern Territory has traditionally been attributed to successive episodes of uplift, erosion and weathering. Investigations of the relationship between the Cretaceous stratigraphy and the nature of deep weathering in the Darwin region show that these surfaces are structurally controlled. A bioturbated bed in the Darwin Member of the Cretaceous Bathurst Island Formation has limited the depth of weathering in this region mainly to the level of the Koolpinyah surface. A silicified horizon in the deeply weathered Cretaceous strata has controlled the level of the Koolpinyah and Wave Hill surfaces elsewhere. Furthermore, the presence of detrital laterite profiles, being the main form of evidence used for the identification of both of these surfaces, is challenged; in many localities these detrital profiles are in fact in situ, discounting the idea that these surfaces developed as a result of successive episodes of pediplantation.

Little is known about the size and ecological importance of any such subsidy as there have been few observational or empirical studies on the topic. We investigated the upstream migration of the amphidromous shrimp, Macrobrachium spinipes (Palaemonidae) in the Daly River, of tropical northern Australia, to determine migration phenology, estimate migration biomass and determine whether migrating shrimps transport marine-derived energy and nutrients upstream. Field observations over 2\u00a0years revealed that juvenile M.\u00a0spinipes migrate upstream en masse during extended periods of declining discharge over a period of 4\u20136\u00a0weeks during the wet season (March\u2013May). In addition, juvenile atyid shrimps from the genus Caridina were also observed migrating upstream during the same period. Fine-scale sampling using fyke nets over 2\u00a0years (2013 and 2014) consistently found discharge to be the strongest predictor of M.\u00a0spinipes and Caridina spp. biomass, while moon illumination and cloud cover were also important predictors. An estimated 10\u201320\u00a0million shrimps migrated upstream during each wet season, transporting c.\u00a0100\u00a0kg of carbon and c.\u00a028\u00a0kg of nitrogen per year. Muscle sulphur stable isotopes (\u03b434S) and exoskeleton strontium isotope ratios (87Sr\/86Sr) were used to establish if marine carbon was transported upstream by the juvenile M.\u00a0spinipes. Isotope data from migratory M.\u00a0spinipes were compared to the non-migratory freshwater Macrobrachium bullatum. No evidence of a marine signature in body tissue or exoskeleton was found using either technique, suggesting very rapid turnover of body tissues This study provides key insights into the migration phenology of amphidromous shrimps and, importantly, suggests that migrating M.\u00a0spinipes do not transport significant amounts of marine-derived energy and nutrients across the marine\/freshwater ecotone. \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","JournalOrPublisher":"Freshwater Biology","Volume":"62","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1111\/fwb.12907","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/epdf\/10.1111\/fwb.12907","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0093Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Novak P.A.; Bayliss P.; Garcia E.A.; Pusey B.J.; Douglas M.M.","Year":"2017","Title":"Ontogenetic Shifts In Habitat Use During The Dry Season By An Amphidromous Shrimp In A Tropical Lowland River","Abstract_Description":"Caridean shrimp have considerable effects on ecosystem processes and, thus, understanding their use of key habitats is important for determining their potential ecological effect. The present study examined the meso-habitat use of Macrobrachium spinipes, a large-bodied and important amphidromous species, in the Daly River, northern Australia. We examined shrimp abundance at four common meso-habitat types; sand bank, rock bars, undercut and structurally complex banks and mid-channel areas at five sites on three occasions during the dry season (May to October). We found that habitat use changed considerably first, with ontogeny, and, second, with the colonisation of habitats with algae and macrophytes as the dry season progressed. As juveniles, their habitat use was strongly associated with well structured bank environments early in the dry season. By the mid-dry season, juveniles were more abundant within sand habitats recently colonised with macrophytes and filamentous algae. Females showed little change in habitat use, whereas large-bodied dominant males generally favoured rock bars and heavily structured bank environments. The present study has provided significant insights into the changes in use of key riverine habitats throughout the dry season by an ecologically important species. This information will be of considerable value to the determination of environmental flow requirements and food-web investigations.","JournalOrPublisher":"Marine And Freshwater Research","Volume":"68","Issue":"12","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/MF16375","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/mf\/mf16375","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0094Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Novak P.A.; Douglas M.M.; A.

A better understanding of the role and life histories of key migratory species is urgently needed to manage the risks posed by development. We investigated the life history of Macrobrachium spinipes (Schenkel, 1902) in the Daly River of the Northern Territory, Australia. We carried out a 13-mo trapping program (2011-2012) at 7 sites along the river between 92 and 405 km from the estuary. We provide the first detailed account of spatial and temporal changes in relative abundance and reproduction, and present information on length at first maturity and Fulton's body condition factor. Reproduction was strongly seasonal and was restricted to the wet-season months of November to April, followed by a recruitment pulse 3 to 4 mo later during the early dry season. Length at first maturity declined as the reproductive season progressed but did not vary significantly with distance from the estuary. Condition was temporally variable and peaked for both sexes immediately after the wet season before declining throughout the dry season. Relative abundance patterns followed a similar pattern. Contrary to results for other Macrobrachium species in rivers of comparable length, we found an increase in the relative abundance of females throughout the river's length during the reproductive season and reproductive effort occurring far upstream, over a restricted time period. This result highlights the importance of maintaining connectivity for reproductive success of this species and further recruitment into these upstream reaches. \u00a9 2015 by The Society for Freshwater Science.","JournalOrPublisher":"Freshwater Science","Volume":"34","Issue":"2","DOI":"DOI:10.1086\/681526","URL":"https:\/\/www.journals.uchicago.edu\/doi\/abs\/10.1086\/681526","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0095Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Riparian management","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Novak P.A.; Fairfield C.A.; Miloshis M.; Knight Z.C.; Lindsay R.; King A.J.","Year":"2021","Title":"Bank Erosion In A Macrotidal Tropical River: Exploring The Relative Impact Of Boat Wash On Riverbank Erosion","Abstract_Description":"Macrotidal tropical rivers are dynamic systems where wet-season floods and tidal flows cause significant riverbank erosion and sediment transport. This study aimed to explore patterns of riverbank erosion and deposition in a large, tropical, macrotidal river in Northern Australia; the Daly River. In particular, we aimed to determine if recreational boat use was impacting bank erosion in this dynamic river. Erosion pins were installed at multiple levels on both banks at 10 sites along a 34 km reach of the river. Measurements were made every four to six weeks during the low water dry season, and opportunistically during the wet season (flooding period) and seasonal transition periods. A bank geotechnical assessment, riverbed cross-sections and site bathymetry were undertaken. Whilst the wet season was a period of substantial erosion (mean rate of 0.64 mm day\u22121), the highest mean erosion rate (3.6 mm day\u22121) was observed in the early dry season (April to May), a period of stabilizing water levels but greatest boat traffic. Bank erosion at this time was measured on both sides of the river and the inside of meander bends, which is atypical of normal riverine bank erosion patterns, and indicative of erosion due to boat wash. As the dry season progressed, significant spatial differences in erosion rates were evident, where erosion was observed at sites upstream of a large shallow sand bar, while sites downstream from the sand bar gained material through the deposition of tidally transported sediment. This study highlights the importance of understanding the significance and interaction of various erosive factors in tropical tidal rivers and has demonstrated that boat wash may be an important contributor to dry season bank erosion in these systems. We encourage management agencies to consider the role of boats in any future river management program in these systems. \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","JournalOrPublisher":"River Research And Applications","Volume":"37","Issue":"1","DOI":"DOI:10.1002\/rra.3736","URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/rra.3736","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0096Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Novak PA; Garcia, EA; Pusey, BJ; Douglas, MM","Year":"2017","Title":"Importance Of The Natural Flow Regime To An Amphidromous Shrimp: A Case Study","Abstract_Description":"Amphidromous shrimp inhabiting large river systems are thought to migrate downstream to hatch larvae close to the estuary or sea. Recent work on Macrobrachium spinipes in northern Australia challenged this hypothesis, with the discovery of abundant females in reproductive condition over 400km upstream. We investigated the early life history of M. spinipes by using a combination of field sampling, laboratory experiments and modelling. We determined the spatial and temporal production of larvae, larval salinity requirements, and, finally, the potential for transport of larvae to the estuary during the wet season. Larvae occurred in high abundances across a 400-km river reach. However, successful larval development was contingent on access, by drift, to saltwater within 7 days. This interval is longer than that found for the majority of amphidromous shrimp species and we propose that larvae in the study river are able to successfully moult through the early stages in freshwater. Large, wet-season discharge events were critical for transporting larvae from all sampled sites to the estuary. The present study confirmed the amphidromous life history of M. spinipes, highlighted the importance of natural flows for maintaining existing populations and provided evidence of a novel type of amphidromous life-history strategy.","JournalOrPublisher":"Marine And Freshwater Research","Volume":"68","Issue":"5","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/MF16034","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/MF\/MF16034","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0097Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Subterranean"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Plant ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"O'Grady A.P.; Eamus D.; Cook P.G.; Lamontagne S.","Year":"2006","Title":"Groundwater Use By Riparian Vegetation In The Wet-Dry Tropics Of Northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"Within Australia and globally there is considerable concern about the potential impacts of groundwater extraction on ecosystems dependent on groundwater. In this study we have combined heat pulse and isotopic techniques to assess groundwater use by riparian vegetation along the Daly River in the Northern Territory. The riparian forests of the Daly River exhibited considerable structural and floristic complexity. More than 40 tree species were recorded during vegetation surveys and these exhibited a range of leaf phonologies, implying complex patterns of water resource partitioning within the riparian forests. Water use was a function of species and season, and stand water use varied between 1.8 and 4.1 mm day-1. In general, however, water use tended to be higher in the wet season than during the dry season, reflecting the contribution to stand water use by dry-season deciduous tree species. There was a strong relationship between stand basal area and stand water use in the wet season, but the strength of this relationship was lower in the dry season. The amount of groundwater use, as determined by analysis of deuterium concentrations in xylem sap, was principally a function of position in the landscape. Trees at lower elevations, closer to the river, used more groundwater than trees higher on the levees. By using a combination of techniques we showed that riparian vegetation along the Daly River was highly groundwater dependent and that these water-use requirements need to be considered in regional management plans for groundwater. \u00a9 CSIRO 2006.","JournalOrPublisher":"Australian Journal Of Botany","Volume":"54","Issue":"2","DOI":"DOI:10.1071\/BT04164","URL":"https:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/BT\/BT04164","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0098Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Riparian"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Plant ecology","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"O'Grady A.P.; Eamus D.; Cook P.G.; Lamontagne S.","Year":"2006","Title":"Comparative Water Use By The Riparian Trees Melaleuca Argentea And Corymbia Bella In The Wet-Dry Tropics Of Northern Australia","Abstract_Description":"We examined sources of water and daily and seasonal water use patterns in two riparian tree species occupying contrasting niches within riparian zones throughout the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia: Corymbia bella Hill and Johnson is found along the top of the levee banks and Melaleuca argentea W. Fitzg. is restricted to riversides. Patterns of tree water use (sap flow) and leaf water potential were examined in four trees of each species at three locations along the Daly River in the Northern Territory. Predawn leaf water potential was higher than -0.5 MPa throughout the dry season in both species, but was lower at the end of the dry season than at the beginning of the dry season. Contrary to expectations, predawn leaf water potential was lower in M. argentea trees along the river than in C. bella trees along the levees. In contrast, mid-day leaf water potential was lower in the C. bella trees than in M. argentea trees. There were no seasonal differences in tree water use in either species. Daily water use was lower in M. argentea trees than in C. bella trees. Whole-tree hydraulic conductance, estimated from the slope of the relationship between leaf water potential and sap flow, did not differ between species. Xylem deuterium concentrations indicated that M. argentea trees along the riverbank were principally reliant on river water or shallow groundwater, whereas C. bella trees along the levee were reliant solely on soil water reserves.

However, wet-dry tropical environments have an extended dry season with periods of low or no flow, and from an ecological perspective, dry-season flows are of vital importance (e.g. Erskine et al., 2003). The dry-season is also the period when potential consumptive water use is likely to be high. Thus it is important to ensure dry-season flows are well predicted. One of the key challenges in undertaking robust water resource assessments across NA is the relatively low density of hydrological data. Using data from 105 catchments in tropical Australia, five daily rainfall-runoff models (RRM) and three methods of regionalising model parameters were compared for the simulation of dry-season flows. To ensure low-flows were well modelled the approach of Petheram et al. (2012) was adopted, where the simulated and observed terms in the objective function were raised to the power of \u03bb. Here six calibration runs were undertaken for each model, using values of 1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.05 for \u03bb. To select the 'best all-round' parameter set we used the method of Petheram et al. (2012), where for each model and for each catchment the 'best all-round' calibrated parameter set was selected based on the weighted combination of different Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metrics. We then compared the best performing RRM and best method of regionalisation against regression-based predictive methods for a wetdry tropical environment. We found that the adoption of multiple criteria to select an optimal parameter set resulted in an improved ability to simulate low flows with no loss in predictive capacity for high flows. An educated transposition of parameter sets from gauged to ungauged catchments was found to be better than random assignment of model parameters, whilst assigning model parameters on the basis of spatial proximity outperformed physical similarity methods. For simulating the lower-half of the flow duration curve no clear method was best for regionalising model parameters and no method was better than randomly assigning intact model parameter sets. The best performing multi-model ensemble (Sacramento and IhacresClassic) and the best method of parameter regionalisation (spatial proximity) performed similarly to statistical regression approaches in predicting mean annual flows. However, the regression approaches demonstrated more skill predicting low-flow metrics. There may be opportunities to improve low-flow NSE metrics under calibration mode through 'smarter' calibration procedures. However, it is thought unlikely that this will result in improved performance under prediction mode.","JournalOrPublisher":"Modsim 2011 - 19Th International Congress On Modelling And Simulation - Sustaining Our Future: Understanding And Living With Uncertainty","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/","File_name":"NO VALUE","Icon":"open_in_new"},{"ID":"0157Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Catchment modelling","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"61\/25825\/102710","Authors":"Romero J.","Year":"2010","Title":"Report For Phase 2 Ord River Irrigation Area Expansion Of The Weaber Plain: Keep River Catchment-River And Hydrodynamic Modelling","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"GHD Pty Ltd, Perth, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0157Or-Romero-2010-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0157Or-Romero-2010-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0158Fi","Catchment":["Fitzroy"],"State":["QLD"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Ecology","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Duivenvoorden L.J.","Year":"1995","Title":"Biological And Ecological Data (Excluding Fisheries) On The Dawson River System With Particular Reference To The Proposed Nathan Dam: August 1995","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"River and Wetland Ecology Group, Central Queensland University","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0158Fi-Duivenvoorden-1995-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0158Fi-Duivenvoorden-1995-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0159Fi","Catchment":["Fitzroy"],"State":["QLD"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"State of Queensland (Department of Natural Resources and Water)","Year":"2006","Title":"Central Queensland: Regional Water Supply Strategy","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"Queensland Government","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0159Fi-State-2006-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0159Fi-State-2006-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0160Da","Catchment":["Daly"],"State":["NT"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water quality","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"175","Authors":"Erskine W.D.; Begg G.W.; Jolly P.; Georges A.; O'Grady A.; Eamus D.; Rea N.; Dostine P.; Townsend S.; Padovan A.","Year":"2003","Title":"Recommended Environmental Water Requirements For The Daly River, Northern Territory, Based On Ecological, Hydrological And Biological Principles.

Where and when it occurs is generally impractical for water resource development and there are large variations in how much comes year to year. There is little or no rain for three to six months every year and potential evapotranspiration rates are very high. Runoff follows a similar pattern to rainfall. The landscape is generally not amenable to storing water and the climate is not conducive to keeping it. Consequently, few rivers flow during the dry season and those that do are fed by groundwater, mostly at discrete points. Groundwater offers potential for increased extractions, but aquifers are seasonally dynamic and there is little opportunity to increase groundwater storage as the aquifers fill during the wet season and drain through the dry. Any change to surface or groundwater regimes will likely have consequences to the environment. Future rainfall is expected to be similar to that experienced historically, with future potential evapotranspiration being slightly higher throughout the year.","JournalOrPublisher":"CSIRO: Water For A Healthy Country Flagship, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0164Gi-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0164Gi-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0165Gi","Catchment":["Gilbert"],"State":["QLD"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"CSIRO ","Year":"2009","Title":"Water In The Gulf Of Carpentaria Drainage Division - Summary Of A Report To The Australian Government From The Csiro Northern Australia Sustainable Yields Project","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"CSIRO: Water For A Healthy Country Flagship, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0165Gi-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0165Gi-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0166Gi","Catchment":["Gilbert"],"State":["QLD"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Journal_Article","Topic":"Conservation ecology","Access_Rights":"Download from Publisher","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Peverell S.C.","Year":"2005","Title":"Distribution Of Sawfishes (Pristidae) In The Queensland Gulf Of Carpentaria, Australia, With Notes On Sawfish Ecology","Abstract_Description":"Pristis microdon, P. zijsron, P. clavata and Anoxypristis cuspidata are distributed throughout the Queensland section of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. In a survey of the four species, Anoxypristis cuspidata was the most abundant and was recorded in both the inshore and offshore set net fisheries. The size distribution and catch locations of A. cuspidata suggest that the inshore area to a depth of 10 m may be the preferred habitat for juveniles of this species, while adults primarily occur offshore. Pristis microdon, P. zijsron and P. clavata were recorded only in the inshore fishery with catches dominated by immature animals. Pristis microdon was caught in the inshore fishery late in the monsoonal wet season (February to April) and inhabited both freshwater and estuarine environments. Pristis zijsron occurred only on the sand and mud flats outside river mouths whilst P. clavata inhabited both the sand and mud flats and upstream estuarine habitats. Observations on reproductive staging and the capture of neonate specimens suggest that in all four pristids, pupping occurred through the wet season until the beginning of the dry season in May. A seasonal set net closure for the barramundi, Lates calcarifer and shark fisheries, which has been in place since 1980 in Queensland Gulf waters, therefore offers a measure of protection to breeding female sawfish and their offspring.

Each mapping unit is described and its area determined. A vegetation map of the proposed dam impoundment and a surrounding envelope has been prepared at a scale of 1:50,000, and then reduced to a scale of 1:100,000 for presentation purposes The report then comments on the conservation status of species and communities observed in the study area. The study has indicated that, apart from the boggomosses, there appear to be no unique areas of vegetation within the proposed impoundment area. All vegetation types within the impoundment are widespread, both within the impoundment itself and downstream of the dam to the junction of the Dawson River with the Mackenzie River. There are, however, conservation concerns regarding some communities. Vegetation map units (1,2,3,and 7) appear to equate to regional ecosystems \"of concern\" and vegetation map unit 10 appears to equate to an \"endangered\" ecosystem. These are listed in a draft report from the Department of Environment on the conservation status of regional ecosystems (Sattler and Williams, in prep.). Of particular conservation concern was the discovery of the rare plant Rutidosis crispata adjacent to the impoundment area, and a detailed survey has been recommended to determine the extent of its occurrence and also whether it extends into the impoundment. (see Discussion subsection Species of Significance). This survey should be undertaken before any decision is made concerning the design FSL for the dam.","JournalOrPublisher":"Hyder Environmental, Hyder Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0170Fi-Dowling-1997-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0170Fi-Dowling-1997-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0171Fi","Catchment":["Fitzroy"],"State":["QLD"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Hydrology","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Markar S.","Year":"1997","Title":"Impact Assessment Study For Proposed Dawson Dam: Hydrology","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"Hyder Environmental, Hyder Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0171Fi-Markar-1997-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0171Fi-Markar-1997-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0172Fi","Catchment":["Fitzroy"],"State":["QLD"],"Habitat_type":["Terrestrial"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Biodiversity","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Jansen A.; Stanisic J.; Ingram G.","Year":"1997","Title":"Impact Assessment Study For Proposed Dawson Dam: Terrestrial Fauna","Abstract_Description":"A major water storage has been proposed for the Dawson River, with the dam to be constructed upstream of Nathan Gorge at 315.3 km AMTD, latitude 150\u00b007' E, longitude 25027' S.

The expansion, referred to as\ngreater Ord Stage 2 included land along the lower Ord (Packsaddle, West Bank, Carlton Station and\nMantinea), the Cockatoo Sands, as well as the Weaber, Keep River and Knox Creek Plains as suitable for\ndevelopment. Construction of the M2 supply channel connecting the Ord River Irrigation Area and\nWeaber Plain, and the final period of irrigation design, environmental management and related approval\nprocesses, commenced in 2010. Approximately 7,400 ha were granted to develop the Weaber Plain, now\nreferred to as Goomig farmlands, requiring 120 GL irrigation supply from Lake Argyle. The farm design in\nthe development is based on the use of an irrigation tail-water management system, with irrigation runoff\nfrom irrigated land to be reused on farms (GHD 2010).\nWetland Research & Management (WRM) were commissioned by LandCorp to survey macroinvertebrate\nand fish assemblages to establish baseline ecological condition, as well as occurrence of listed species,\nincluding targeted sampling for sawfish and Glyphis sharks. WRM were then commissioned to undertake\nthree pre-development baseline surveys of the Keep River, with surveys completed in 2011, 2012 and\n2013. Part of baseline data collection was to also provide data on sediment and water quality that were\nused to develop interim local surface water trigger values for assessing effects of any discharge to the\nKeep River. WRM applied standardised methodology across all three baseline surveys (2011, 2012 & 2013)\nand thereby developed a robust baseline to allow detection of any future impacts from the ORIA Stage 2.\nProject Conditions require three-post-development surveys to assess changes to listed species and\necosystem health as a result of the development.

These comprise all of Australia\u2019s known sawfish species, including the three species protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, i.e. Freshwater Sawfish (Pristis microdon), Dwarf Sawfish (Pristis clavata) and Green Sawfish (Pristis zijsron). The Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki), which was only described in 2008, has only recently been discovered in the Kimberley and is listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act. These species are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and collectively represent ~45% of Australia\u2019s elasmobranchs that are listed as Vulnerable or higher under the EPBC Act. There is, however, limited information on the spatial extent of these species throughout Western Australia, particularly as most sawfish surveys have targeted only a few specific areas over a vast coastline. We therefore encouraged public participation in providing Pristis rostra, taken from the fish as curios, in order to extend the known locations of the species and relate these to life history stages based on their size. Here we report on the published records and our unpublished catches (n = 376) across three Pristis spp., and collate this with data from donated rostra, 73% (n = 283) of which were considered usable, in that catch locations were reliable and they were from Western Australian waters. We provide information on sawfish distributions in Western Australia and identify areas that are important as pupping grounds, nursery areas or harbour mature individuals. We also collate known records of G. garricki and provide information on the ecology of this and the EPBC listed sawfish species.","JournalOrPublisher":"Journal Of The Royal Society Of Western Australia","Volume":"94","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0183Fi-Morgan-2011-Journal_Article.pdf","File_name":"0183Fi-Morgan-2011-Journal_Article.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0184Da","Catchment":["Daly","Gilbert","Ord","Northern Australia"],"State":["NT","QLD","WA","Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"McJannet D.L.; Wallace J.W.; Henderson A.; McMahon J.","Year":"2009","Title":"High And Low Flow Regime Changes At Environmental Assets Across Northern Australia Under Future Climate And Development Scenarios","Abstract_Description":"The National Water Commission \u2013 on behalf of the Council of Australian Governments and in consultation with the Australian Government Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts \u2013 commissioned CSIRO to assess the water resources of northern Australia, covering the Timor Sea and Gulf of Carpentaria drainage divisions and that part of the North-East Coast Drainage Division that lies north of Cairns (Figure A).

Subsequent chapters report at the region level. In particular, Chapters SE-1, SE-2 and SE-3 focus on the South-East Gulf region (Figure SE-1). This chapter summarises the water resources of the South-East Gulf region, using information from Chapter SE-2 and Chapter SE-3, and directly addresses the Terms of Reference, specifically terms 3, 4 and 5 as listed in the Preamble. Essentially, this chapter provides a synoptic view of the region and covers: regional observations; water resource assessment; seasonality of water resources; surface\u2013groundwater interaction; changes to flow regime at environmental assets; water storage options; data and knowledge gaps.

Where and when it occurs is generally impractical for water resource development and there are large variations in how much comes year to year. There is little or no rain for three to six months every year and potential evapotranspiration rates are very high. Runoff follows a similar pattern to rainfall. The landscape is generally not amenable to storing water and the climate is not conducive to keeping it. Consequently, few rivers flow during the dry season and those that do are fed by groundwater, mostly at discrete points. Groundwater offers potential for increased extractions, but aquifers are seasonally dynamic and there is little opportunity to increase groundwater storage as the aquifers fill during the wet season and drain through the dry. Any change to surface or groundwater regimes will likely have consequences to the environment. Future rainfall is expected to be similar to that experienced historically, with future potential evapotranspiration being slightly higher throughout the year.","JournalOrPublisher":"CSIRO: Water For A Healthy Country Flagship, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0197Da-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0197Da-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0198Da","Catchment":["Daly","Ord","Northern Australia"],"State":["NT","WA","Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater","Subterranean"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"CSIRO ","Year":"2009","Title":"Water In The Timor Sea Drainage Division - Summary Of A Report To The Australian Government From The Csiro Northern Australia Sustainable Yields Project","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"CSIRO: Water For A Healthy Country Flagship, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0198Da-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0198Da-CSIRO-2009-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0199No","Catchment":["Northern Australia"],"State":["Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["NO VALUE"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Climate change","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology","Year":"2022","Title":"State of the Climate","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"Commonwealth of Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0199No-CSIRO-2022-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0199No-CSIRO-2022-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0200Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["Freshwater"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water quality","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"12585264","Authors":"GHD ","Year":"2023","Title":"Managing Water Quality to Enable Future Irrigation Development in the Kimberley Region: Three-Dimensional Hydrodynamic Modelling to Evaluate the Effect of Farm Chemicals on the Lower Pools of the Keep River","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"GHD Pty Ltd, Perth, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0200Or-GHD-2023-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0200Or-GHD-2023-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0201No","Catchment":["Northern Australia"],"State":["Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["Subterranean"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Climate change","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Barron O., Pollock D., Crosbie R., Dawes W., Charles S., Mpelasoka F., Aryal S., Donn M.\nand Wurcker B","Year":"2010","Title":"The impact of climate change on groundwater resources: The climate sensitivity of groundwater recharge in Australia","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"CSIRO: Water For A Healthy Country Flagship, Australia","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0201No-Barron-2010-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0201No-Barron-2010-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0202Da","Catchment":["Daly","Gilbert","Ord","Northern Australia"],"State":["NT","QLD","WA","Northern Australia"],"Habitat_type":["NO VALUE"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Hydrology","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"Srikanthan S., Bende-Michl U., Oke A., Hope P., Matic V., Kahn Z., Thomas S., Sharples W., Kociuba G., Peter J., Vogel E., Wilson L., Turner M.","Year":"2022","Title":"Monsoonal North \u2014 National Hydrological Projections Assessment report","Abstract_Description":"[No abstract available]","JournalOrPublisher":"Bureau of Meteorology","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO VALUE","DOI":"NO VALUE","URL":"\/documents\/0202Da-Srikanthan-2022-Technical_Report.pdf","File_name":"0202Da-Srikanthan-2022-Technical_Report.pdf","Icon":"file_download"},{"ID":"0203Or","Catchment":["Ord"],"State":["WA"],"Habitat_type":["NO VALUE"],"Category":"Technical_Report","Topic":"Water resources management","Access_Rights":"Free to Download","Project_ID":"NO VALUE","Authors":"CSIRO ","Year":"2009","Title":"Water in the Kimberley region, pp 129-182 in CSIRO (2009) Water in the Timor Sea Drainage Division.

The four-year (2016\u201320) program focused on better understanding the potential mineral, energy and groundwater resources in northern Australia. In this investigation we use models of sub-surface bulk electrical conductivity within the geological Daly Basin to model the depth of the interface between the Jinduckin Formation and the overlying Oolloo Dolostone. The Oolloo Dolostone is the most productive aquifer in the Daly Basin, while the Jinduckin Formation is an aquitard separating the Oolloo from the deeper Tindall Limestone aquifer. Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data acquired across the basin were inverted with both deterministic and stochastic methods to generate a suite of bulk electrical conductivity models. Comparison with boreholes suggests that the Jinduckin Formation is significantly more conductive than the Oolloo Dolostone and the interface between them is well resolved in these AEM conductivity models. We developed an interactive plot for visualising the probability distribution of bulk conductivities for AEM points inverted with the stochastic inversion routine. We interpreted 389 AEM points using this approach and used interpolation to derive a new stratigraphic Oolloo\u2013Jinduckin surface. The new surface is generally deeper than current models of the interface, which were derived by interpolating stratigraphic picks from boreholes. In the data-sparse southwest of the Daly Basin the new geological surface interpreted from the AEM is significantly deeper than the previous model. New drilling, geophysics and other field data from data-sparse areas of the basin are required to validate and refine our model. This new interface can be used to better constrain aquifer architecture in groundwater flow modelling and support groundwater management of this region. The method developed for interpreting stratigraphy directly from the posterior probability distribution of electrical conductivity is applicable for other geophysical interpretation tasks.","JournalOrPublisher":"Geoscience Australia, Canberra","Volume":"NO VALUE","Issue":"NO
