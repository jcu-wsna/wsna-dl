              Discussions around environmental values and management, and
              potential development in northern Australia, generate considerable
              debate. It is important that all members of our community have
              access to relevant published material. Often, information on
              environmental issues and values is not easily located. Some of
              this may be behind pay walls or may have had limited circulation,
              especially for older reports and materials. Genuine public
              participation requires easier and more equal access to all
              relevant information.

              The Water Security for Northern Australia digital library provides
              a platform which compiles and provides access to key scientific
              reports, publications and data on previous research for 4 selected
              river catchments in northern Australia where pressure for
              increased water utilisation is high – Ord (WA), Daly-Katherine
              (NT), Gilbert (QLD) and lower Fitzroy (QLD). This platform
              provides access to previous scientific publications and research
              which has primarily taken place in these catchments. In the
              future, we would like to extend this digital library to additional
              catchments.

                >Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern
                Australia</a
              >
              (CRCNA). The program is being delivered by three north
              Australian-based universities (James Cook University, Charles
              Darwin University and CQ University). The program aims to
              undertake research in selected catchments of northern Australia,
              that provides more information to decision-makers on water
              resource availability and allocation, environmental impacts and
              management, greater economic returns from the use of water
              resources and greater Indigenous benefit from water resources. One
              of the many activities of this program is this digital library
              resource.

              The development of this digital library will be ongoing with
              material continually being added. The digital library may extend
              to new catchments as resources allow. If you are aware of relevant
              reports not included in this library, please make us aware and
              provide a link to, or copy, of that material.
